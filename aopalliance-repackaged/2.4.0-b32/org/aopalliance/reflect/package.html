    <p>This package provides a set of interfaces for implementing a
    generic reflection API.</p>
    
    <p>The motivations of this package are to have a generic
    reflection API with interfaces so that any AO system provider can
    implement its own base program introspection package. In general,
    we cannot use <code>java.lang.reflect</code> since in most of the
    AOP systems, this representation is not available (e.g. in
    load-time systems or compile-time systems).

    <p>The implementor can implement this API for compile-time purpose
    (for instance based on a source-code analysis implementation), for a
    load-time purpose (mostly based on a bytecode-level
    implementation), or for a run-time purpose.

    <p>This package has be rougthly specified and really needs further
    investigations.
