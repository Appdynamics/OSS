    <p>This package provides an API for program instrumentation. </p>
    
    <p>This package provides a set of interfaces for applying
    intrumentations on a program, i.e. a program modification which
    adds some feature (methods, classes, code) to the original
    program. These instrumentations are abstractly defined and can
    occur at compile-time, load-time, or runtime depending on the
    {@link org.aopalliance.instrument.Instrumentor}
    implementation. Moreover, since it uses the {@link
    org.aopalliance.reflect} package which provides an abstract
    representation of the program, the instrumentations can be
    implemented at a source-code level or at a bytecode level,
    depending on the implementation.

    <p>This API is specific to AOP. This means that the set of program
    instrumentations that is allowed is a restricted set compared to a
    general-purpose API. However, general-purpose transformation
    tools should provide an implementation of this API in order to be
    easily used by several AO systems.

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
     
    <p>This package requires the {@link org.aopalliance.reflect} package.

<!-- <p>It is typically used by <code>org.aopalliance.core</code>
    package (but in an optional mode).  -->
