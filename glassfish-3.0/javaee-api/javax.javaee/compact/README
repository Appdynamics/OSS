This Maven project takes a javax.javaee-api.jar and strip the implementation classes.
The original script, run.sh and DIY.java are provided by: Roberto.Chinnici@Sun.COM 

To execute:


mvn -Djavaee.jar=<location of javax.javaee-api.jar> -Djar.name=<output of jar name> clean install

where properties are:
javaee.jar is the location of the javax.javaee jar file containing both api and impl.
jar.name is the final name of the jar file.

Maven will copy the dependencies activation.jar and mail.jar to a tmp directory in target.  It will compile DIY.java and run the script, run.sh, to generate the compacted javax.javaee-api.jar with the stripped implementation classes.
