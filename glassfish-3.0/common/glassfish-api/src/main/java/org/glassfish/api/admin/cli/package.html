Provides for command line interface on the server side. This package contents are not related to the command line
interface per se, but they are related to the command implementation classes on the server side.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The annotations and enums in this package are supposed to be used as described below.

<ol>
    <li>
        To specify a required String option "--jndi-name", that cannot repeat on a command line:
        <pre>
            &#64;Option (name="jndi-name", symbol='j', required=true)
            private volatile String jndiName;
        </pre>
        Such an option is specified as either "--jndi-name = jdbc/mysql" or "--jndi-name jdbc/mysql or
        "-j=jdbc/mysql" or "-j jdbc/mysql" on the command line.
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify an optional boolean option "force" that cannot repeat on a command line, you can either use:
        <pre>
            &#64;Option (symbol='f', type=OptionType.BOOLEAN, defaultValue="false", legalValues={"true", "false"})
            private volatile String force;
        </pre>
        OR:
        <pre>
            &#64;Option (symbol='f' defaultValue=false)
            private volatile boolean force;
            OR:
            &#64;Option (symbol='f')
            private volatile boolean force = false;
        </pre>

        Such an option is specified as either "--force" or "-f" or "--no-force" or "--force=true" or "--force=false"
        on the command line. Not specifying it on the command line makes it assume its deault value specified by the
        value of the field (2nd case above) or the value of annotation field, defaultValue (1st case above).
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify a required option that is secret (password) information, you should use:
        <pre>
            &#64;Option (type=OptionType.PASSWORD, required=true)
            private volatile String password;
        </pre>
        Such an option is treated specially by the command line. Note the following in this regard:
        <ul>
            <li> The command line client shall reject specification of password on the command line as "--password
            secret123". Such a specification is a syntax error, because the client knows that --password specifies
            password information and it will not accept it on command line in plaintext.
            </li>
            <li> Such an option can be specied in a file named "password-file" as the value of a property
            named AS_ADMIN_[option-name] (for compatibility reasons) or AS_ADMIN_[command-name][option-name].
            </li>
            <li> Such an option will be prompted for by the client if not specified in a file.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify a "property" (i.e. name=value) option that may or may not repeat, the command implementation
        should specify it as a Map, e.g.
        <pre>
          &#64;Option (name="property" repeats=true/false, type=OptionType.PROPERTY)
          private final Map &lt; String, String &gt; properties;
        </pre>
        Such an option can be specified as: --property prop1=value1 --property prop2=value2 or --property=name1=value1
        --property=name2=value2 on the command line depdending on the value of <i>repeats</i>. Note that the type
	PROPERTY is a special treatment for a commonly used pattern where command implementations need to process <i>properties</i>.
        <p>
        Any use of '=' in the property names and values needs to be escaped with a backslash.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify an option that specifies a number of properties, use OptionType.PROPERTIES when the properties are
        delimited by a ':' (this is chosen for compatibility reasons). For example,
        <pre>
            &#64;Option (name="connection-properties", repeats=false, type=OptionType.PROPERTIES)
            private final Map &lt; String, String &gt; properties;
        </pre>
        This can be specified as --connection-properties dbname=Oracle:url=jdbc\:localhost\:4456 which means there are
        two properties with names dbname and url and values Oracle and jdbc:localhost:4456 respectively.   
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify an option that represents a "file":
        <pre>
            &#64;Option (name="file", type=OptionType.FILE)
            private volatile File f;                
        </pre>
        This option is specified as --file foo.jar and results in a binary file upload from the client to the server.
        The file is uploaded in a specific area and that file is then injected into this variable.
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify a required operand that's a string, use:
        <pre>
            &#64;Operand (required=true)
            private volatile String server;
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify an operand whose type depends upon the value of another option:
        <pre>
        &#64;Operand (required=true, type=OptionType.FILE)
        &#64;TypeOverride (type=OptionType.FILE_PATH, options="upload", values="false")
        private volatile File f;
        </pre>
        This operand is interpreted as a file by default, but if another option ("--upload") is "false", then it is
        just a path to a file. A FILE_PATH is treated specially by the client in that its absolute value is sent from the client
        to the server.
	<p>
	Note that no dependency graph is calculated here. &#64;TypeOverride is intended for simple cases where there are 
	primary options and others depend on them. 
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify multiple operands that are all strings:
        <pre>
            &#64;Operand (type=OptionType.STRING, required=true)
            private final String[] names;
            OR:
            &#64;Operand (type=OptionType.STRING, required=true)
            private final List &lt; String &gt; names;
        </pre>
	Note that for the multiple operand case, you must use either a List or an Array. If a command does not have any field
	annotated with &#64;Operand, it does not take any operand and if such a command line is presented with an operand (when
	all options run out (no pun intended) what remain on the command line are operands) it is a syntax error.
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify multiple operands that are all files:
        <pre>
            &#64;Operand (type=OptionType.FILE, required=true)
            private final File[] files;
            OR:
            &#64;Operand (type=OptionType.FILE, required=true)
            private final List &lt; File &gt; files;            
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>
