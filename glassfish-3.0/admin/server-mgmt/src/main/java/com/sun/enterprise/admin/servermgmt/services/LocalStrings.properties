CertificateDN=Distinguished Name of the self-signed X.509 Server Certificate is:\n[{0}]
SomeProblemWithKeytool= Domain creation process involves a step that creates primary key and\n self-signed server certificate. This step failed for the reason shown below.\n This could be because JDK provided keytool program could not be found (e.g.\n you are running with JRE) or for some other reason. No need to panic, as you\n can always use JDK-keytool program to do the needful. A temporary JKS-keystore\n will be created. You should replace it with proper keystore before using it for SSL.\n Refer to documentation for details. Actual error is:\n{0}

* /usr/sbin/svcadm enable {4} // start\n\
* /usr/sbin/svcadm disable {4} // stop\n\
* /usr/sbin/svccfg delete {4} // uninstall
