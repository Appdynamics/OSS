All of the code in this package was salvaged from the [appserv-commons] module
of the AppServer.  It was copied here in order to guarantee that the
backup-restore module is completely independent of all AppServer code.  The
classes were modified slightly.  I.e. methods that aren't needed were removed. 
The methods that <strong>are</strong> used were not modified.  
<p>
Thus simply by removing this package and changing import statements in the
calling code, the original AppServer classes can be used directly.
