Provides the callers for a particular method of MBeanServerConnection interface.
Instead of having a mammoth class that calls various methods of this interface,
a caller is designed to call a particular method. There is one caller for a
method. This also gives a good control over the support that we want to have in
the implementation. e.g. following methods of MBeanServerConnection are
not supported in S1AS8.0:
<ul>
 <li> addNotificationListener and all the variants of same </li>
 <li> removeNotificationListener and all the variants of same </li>
 <li> unregisterMBean </li>
</ul>

Every caller is supposed to call the method that corresponds to the integer
constant in MBeanServerRequestMessage.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
