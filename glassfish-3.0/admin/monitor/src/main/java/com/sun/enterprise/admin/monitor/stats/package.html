Provides for <b>implementations of various Stats interfaces.</b> These Stats interfaces
are based on those defined by JSR 77. Besides this, implementations of
various Statistic interfaces are also provided here. A new Statistic is
introduced named <b> StringStatistic </b>.
<P>
When we analyze the Statistic interfaces that are defined by the J2EE Management
Standard, it is evident that they are view-only data structures providing the
accessors for various statistical data, e.g. CountStatistic. Every instance of
CountStatistic is allowed to have only a <EM> getCount </EM> method (in
addition to other meta data accessors), that returns a long. This limits the
usability of these Statistic interfaces by the actual components that gather the
data, because new instances of these interfaces have to be constructed as
and when a query or measurement of that statistic is made. On the other hand, it
is much more flexible to have mutators within implementations of these Statistic
interfaces. But then, there is a possibility that the client who receives
instances of these interfaces inadvertantly changes a particular statistic.
<P>
To solve this problem, this package makes the following provision:
<P>
It defines Statistic classes that have a <i>State</i>. A component that gathers
data has to do the following:
<ul>
    
  <li> Implement the specific Stats interface. e.g. EJBCacheStats. This interface 
    has a method which returns number of beans in cache as an instance of BoundedRangeStatistic. 
  </li>
    
  <li> Initialize an instance of MutableBoundedRangeStatistic with an initial 
    state. This interface exposes all the necessary methods that are required 
    to reflect the change in state. </li>
    
  <li> Since MutableBoundedRangeStatistic provides a method that returns an unmodifiable 
    view of itself, calls the MutableBoundedRangeStatistic.unmodifiableView() 
    which returns BoundedRangeStatistic. This returned value can safely be sent 
    to the caller to which everything is transparent.</li>
</ul>

Note that these Mutable* interfaces/classes are not exposed to clients. Clients 
will only receive instances of Statistics that are part of the J2EE Management 
Standard. 
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Following Stats interfaces are part of this package. All of these extend the
org.glassfish.j2ee.statistics.Stats interface.
<ul>
  <li>EJBCacheStats</li>
  <li>EJBMethodStats</li>
  <li>EJBPoolStats</li>
  <li>OrbConnectionManagerStats</li>
  <li>OrbThreadPoolStats</li>
  <li>SunOneJVMStats</li>
</ul>

Following new Statistic interfaces are defined by this package. They extend the 
org.glassfish.j2ee.statistics.Statististic interface. 
<ul>
  <li>StringStatistic - A String equivalent of CountStatistic.</li>
  <li>MutableStatistic - A Statistic that has some mutators. It is expected to 
    be handled with care.</li>
  <li>MutableCountStatistic - A CountStatistic/BoundedRangeStatistic that is mutable.</li>
  <li>MutableTimeStatistic - A TimeStatistic that is mutable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following are the implementations of various Statistic interfaces in org.glassfish.j2ee.statistics 
  package.</p>
<table width="60%" border="1">
  <tr bgcolor="#0066FF"> 
    <td>Interface</td>
    <td>Immutable Implementation (read-only -- for clients)</td>
    <td>Mutable Implementation (read-write -- for core components)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>CountStatistic</td>
    <td>CountStatisticImpl</td>
    <td>MutableCountStatisticImpl<br>
      It implements MutableCountStatistic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>BoundedRangeStatistic</td>
    <td>BoundedRangeStatisticImpl</td>
    <td>MutableBoundedRangeStatisticImpl<br>
      It implements MutableCountStatistic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TimeStatistic</td>
    <td>TimeStatisticImpl</td>
    <td>MutableTimeStatisticImpl<br>
      It implements MutableTimeStatistic.</td>

Following is a helper implementation done in this package: GenericStatsImpl.
<p>
This class is designed to facilitate the general implementation of {@link
Stats} interface and all the classes that implement this interface can leverage
this class. The main idea is that this class implements:
<ul>
    <li>getStatistic(String)</li>
    <li>getStatistics()</li>
    <li>getStatisticNames()</li>
</ul>
in a reflective manner. Thus, e.g. a specific implementation of EJBPoolStats like
EJBPoolStatsImpl can make use of this class to implement above methods in a
generic manner.
