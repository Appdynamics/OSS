# This file contains GlassFish V2 asadmin commands that are NOT carried 
# forward to GlassFish v3. This is a very simple file with one command name 
# per line. Anything with a leading # '#' like this line is treated a comment.
# An 'L' or 'R' at the end tells you if it's a Local or Remote command.
# I know it is a maintenance headache, but this file is needed to move to a 
# more sensible command line syntax and separation of command options
# from asadmin program options. For details, see CLI spec for GlassFish v3.
# Also see the companion list of commands -- supported-legacy-command-names
