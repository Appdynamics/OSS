Administration Commands                           start-domain(1)

NAME
     start-domain - starts a domain

SYNOPSIS
     start-domain  [--domaindir domain-dir]
     --user admin_user --passwordfile file_name
     [--terse={true|false}] [ --echo ={true|false}]
     [ --interactive ={true|false}] [ --verbose ={true|false}]
     [ --debug ={true|false}] [domain_name]

DESCRIPTION
     Use the start-domain command  to  start  a  domain.  If  the
     domain directory is not specified, the domain in the default
     install_dir/domains directory is started. If there  are  two
     or more domains, the domain_name operand must be specified.

     You can use the start-domain command to upgrade  domains  of
     Application Server 8.x or 9.0 to Application Server 9.1. Use
     one of the following ways to upgrade your domain:

         o    Perform an  in-place  upgrade  of  the  Application
              Server  binaries.  When you run start-domain on the
              domains pointing to the earlier version of Applica-
              tion Server, asadmin invokes the asupgrade command,
              and the  domains  are  automatically  upgraded  in-
              place.

         o    Perform a side-by-side upgrade of  the  Application
              Server binaries. Run start-domain on the domains of
              your earlier installation.  The  asupgrade  command
              upgrades  the  domains  to  the domains root of the
              latest Application  Server  installation.  In  this
              scenario,  the  target directory for the upgrade is
              defined   in   the   AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH   in   the
              asenv.conf.

     On the Mac OS X platform, processes can  bind  to  the  same
     port.  To  avoid this problem, do not start multiple domains
     with the same port number at the same time.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir

         The directory where the domain  is  to  be  started.  If
         specified,  the  path must be accessible in the filesys-
         tem.  If  not  specified,  the  domain  in  the  default
         install_dir/domains directory is started.

Administration Commands                           start-domain(1)

     -u --user

         The authorized domain application server  administrative
         username.

     --passwordfile
         The file containing the domain application server  pass-
         word  associated  with  the administrative instance. The
         password   is   defined   in   the    following    form:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password. Where password is the actual
         administrator password for the domain.

     -t--terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         to the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     --verbose
         By default this flag is set to false. If  set  to  true,
         detailed server startup output is displayed. On Windows,
         press CTRL-Break in the  domain's   window  to  print  a
         thread  dump.  On  UNIX, press CTRL-C to kill the server
         and press CTRL-\ to print a thread dump.

     --debug

         By default this flag is set to false. If  set  to  true,
         the  server is started in debug mode and prints the JPDA
         port on the console.

OPERANDS
     domain_name         The unique name of the domain  you  wish
                         to start.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the start-domain command

       asadmin> start-domain domain1
       Starting Domain domain1, please wait.
       Log redirected to /usr/appserver/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
       Redirecting output to /usr/appserver/domains/domain1/logs/server.log
       Domain domain1 started.
       Domain [domain1] is running [Sun Java System Application Server 9.1 (build
       b50d-beta3)] with its configuration and logs at: [/usr/appserver/domains].
       Admin Console is available at [http://localhost:4848].
       Use the same port [4848] for "asadmin" commands.

       Standard JMX Clients (like JConsole) can connect to JMXServiceURL:
       [service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://pdavies.SFBay.Sun.COM:8686/jmxrmi] for domain
       management purposes.
       Domain listens on at least following ports for connections:
       [8080 8181 4848 3700 3820 3920 8686 ].
       Domain supports application server clusters and other standalone instances.

     Where: domain1 is the domain in  the  /usr/appserver/domains
     directory.
