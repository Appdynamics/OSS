This is a project (POM) created to help admin backend developers. If
you are an admin developer, you have to deal with sources scattered
over GFv3 workspace, at the same time, there are sources that you don't
ever touch during your normal development. This rules out the possibility
of top-level v3/pom.xml to be opened by your favorite IDE. What I have
done here is "hand-picked" the parts of GFv3 workspace so that you can
open all those parts "as a single maven/IDE project". The benefits of
doing this are:
0- You don't need the entire sources (although this assumes that all of
   the workspace is actually checked out) and can only open single
   project.
1- You don't need to open multiple projects in IDE.

I have tested this with Intellij 8.1.3 and it works great (for me).
Typically, here is what I do:
- checkout v3 source code and build it once.
- open <v3>/admin/debug/pom.xml in your favorite IDE that supports POM
  (e.g. NetBeans, Intellij).
- in a shell, do: mvn dependency:sources -> this downloads all the
  other sources (external dependencies) in your local repo, should you
  need to debug them.
