/** Contains configuration change listeners that listen for specific config
 *  events. With a config listener, there are two things that need to happen:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li> Implementation of the config listener for a particular @Configured interface</li>
 *    <li> Registration of the config listener implementation with the @Configured interface </li>
 *  </ul>
 * Classes in this package should do the former, only.
