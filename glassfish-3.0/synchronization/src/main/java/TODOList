- manifest generator updates *creating manifest with excludes* (priority low)
- fix admin server to deal with multiple manifests
- fix load balancer
	-- on reset remove it from balancer
- what to do if the manifest is updated (high priority). this actually causes a lot of problems because what happens
  we start grizzly client app and manifest changes do we stop 
- test the restart stuff create a method that just throws an IOException and see what happens
- on reset don't reinit everything have each context item have a reset method
- create a visualization tool to watch the graph grow
- change the load to queries per second that are served
