<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><b><a href="./binaries.html">Go to the download page</a></b></p>
<p>Jmxcmd is a command line interface (shell) for accessing JMX servers based 
  upon the <a href="./jcmd-index.html">JCmd</a> command-line-interface framework. 
  It supports the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all features of <a href="./jcmd-index.html">JCmd</a></li>
  <li>access to attributes, operations, notifications for MBeans in one or more 
    MBean servers.</li>
  <li>an SPI for adding additional protocols (Connectors)</li>
  <li>an extensible (pluggable) command set</li>
  <li>a CLI compliant with SUSv3 and Sun Microsystems CLIP standards</li>
  <li>invocation either from a shell or in interactive mode.</li>

<h2>2. Overview</h2>
<p>The following sections discuss some key concepts used by jmxcmd which should 
  be understood to use it effectively.</p>
<h3>2.1 jmxcmd shell<a name="jmxcmdShell"></a></h3>
<p>Jmxcmd may be invoked either conventionally via one's usual command shell, 
  or in an interactive mode. Example:</p>
<p><i>Single invocation</i>:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">bash-2.05$ jmxcmd get &quot;*&quot; 
  &quot;*&quot;<br>
  ...</font></p>
<p><i>Interactive mode</i>:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">bash-2.05$ jmxcmd<br>
  jmxcmd&gt; get * *<br>
  ...</font></p>
<p>Note that in the above examples, it was necessary to quote the &quot;*&quot; 
  within the shell to force it to be passed literally to jmxcmd. This was not 
  necessary within jmxcmd.</p>
<p>State is saved by jmxcmd in the user's home directory. This makes it possible 
  to issue commands that implicitly connect to the appropriate MBean server last 
  specified as default.</p>
<p>Most commands have abbreviations available; refer to the help for each command. 
  All commands have both long and short names for command options (if any).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>2.2 Using JMX ObjectNames<a name="UsingObjectNames"></a></h3>
<p>JMX ObjectNames can be long and tedious. To address this, jmxcmd takes a 
  two-pronged approach: (1) aliases (see <a href="#Aliases">Aliases</a>), and 
  (2) shorthand notation. Shorthand notation is designed to be unambiguous, but 
  still allow increased useability. The rules are as follows:</p>
<table width="94%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td width="4%">#</td>
    <td width="28%"><b>Rule</b></td>
    <td width="39%"><b>Comments</b></td>
    <td width="29%"><b>Restrictions</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="4%" height="28">1</td>
    <td width="28%" height="28">JMX domain may be omitted</td>
    <td width="39%" height="28">Absence of a ':' in the pattern is interepreted 
      as meaning the default domain.</td>
    <td width="29%" height="28"> 
      <p> The presence of a ':' disables this shortcut.</p>
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="4%">2</td>
    <td width="28%"> 
      <p>&quot;,*&quot; may be omitted at the end of a name</p>
    </td>
    <td width="39%">If the ObjectName does not match an MBean, an implicit &quot;,*&quot; 
      is appended, and if exactly one MBean matches, then the match succeeds, 
      otherwise it fails.</td>
    <td width="29%">Adding the &quot;,* matches whatever would normally match 
      as a pattern--0 or more MBeans.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="4%">3</td>
    <td width="28%">fully-specified name takes precedence</td>
    <td width="39%">Specifying an ObjectName fully will always work correctly.</td>
    <td width="29%">None.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Examples:</p>
<table width="93%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td width="48%"><b>Abbreviated Name</b></td>
    <td width="52%"><b>Interpretation (in precedence order):</b></td>

    <td width="52%">

<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2.3 Aliases<a name="Aliases"></a></h3>
<p>MBean ObjectNames can be long and unwieldy. Additionally, it may be convenient 
  to refer to more than one MBean either as a set of names or via a wildcard mechanism. 
  For this and similar reasons, jmxcmd provides the notion of <i>objectname 
  aliases</i>, hereafter referred to simply as <i>aliases</i>. An alias is simply 
  a convenient variable which contains a value that resolves to zero or more MBean 
  ObjectNames.</p>
<p>Four commands are available for managing aliases. They include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#target-aliases">create-target-alias</a></li>
  <li><a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#target-aliases">delete-target-alias</a></li>
  <li><a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#target-aliases">resolve-target-alias</a></li>
  <li><a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#target-aliases">list-target-aliases</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For details on each command, click on its name. Once an alias has been established, 
  it may be used in place of an ObjectName. Here is an example:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">jmxcmd &gt; get --attributes 
  * MyMBeans</font></p>
<p>The above invocation will show all attributes available on the MBeans referred 
  to by the alias 'MyMBeans'. Aliases may be nested; they may contain other aliases 
  and even a mix of aliases an ObjectName patterns. One minor restriction is in 
  place--ObjectNames that contain a space character may not be aliased.</p>
<h3>2.4 Default target<a name="DefaultTarget"></a></h3>
<p>Most of the jmxcmd commands operation on MBeans, thus requiring and operand 
  or operands specifying the MBeans. If an operand (target) is not given, then 
  the default target is used. The default target is set using the <a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#target">target</a> 
  command.</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">jmxcmd&gt; target server:*<br>
  ...<br>
  </font><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">jmxcmd&gt; target MyMBeans</font></p>
<h3>2.6 Specifying target(s)<a name="SpecifyingTargets"></a></h3>
<p>Many commands take a list of targets upon which the operation acts, specified 
  as operands to the command. A target may be a fully qualified ObjectName, an 
  ObjectName pattern, or an alias, and there may be more than one of them. The 
  set of these operands and ultimately what they resolve to defines the set of 
  MBeans upon which the operation is performed. Certain special characters may 
  be used with the targets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the '!' character may be used to reverse the set that the target selects.</li>
  <li>with more than one operand, the '+', '-' and '&amp;' characters modify the 
    set of targets so far, from left to right. The '-' operator substracts the 
    target from the set so far, the '+' operator adds to it (same as no qualifier), 
    and the '&amp;' character performs a logical and of the target and the set 
    so far.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>1. Displays all MBeans not denoted by the alias &quot;MyMBeans&quot;:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">jmxcmd&gt; find !MyMBeans</font></p>
<p>2. Displays all MBeans which have the property-pair &quot;category=config&quot; 
  and that are also in the domain &quot;Test&quot;. In this example, the target 
  &quot;category=config&quot; is an ObjectName pattern that matches any MBean 
  containing a Property &quot;category&quot; with value &quot;config&quot;. The 
  target &quot;&amp;Test:*&quot; further selects only those MBeans that are in 
  the domain &quot;Test&quot;; the &quot;&amp;&quot; specifies the intersection 
  of the &quot;Test:*&quot; expression with the &quot;category=config&quot; MBeans.</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">jmxcmd&gt; find category=config 
  &amp;Test:*</font></p>
<p>3. Displays all MBeans that have an operation containing the string &quot;Test&quot;, 
  &quot;test&quot;, or &quot;TEST&quot; or an attribute containing &quot;Count&quot; 
  or &quot;count&quot; in the default domain that don't have an ObjectName property 
  &quot;category=config&quot;:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">jmxcmd&gt; find --operations=*Test*,*test*,*TEST* 
  --attributes=*count*,*Count* :* -category=config</font></p>
<p></p>
<h3>2.6 Providers<a name="Providers"></a></h3>
<p>Not all servers uses the standard JSR 160 (Remote JMX) Connectors, and even 
  if they do, they can still require their own product-specific information, such 
  as authentication information. To work around both of these issues, the <a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#providers">providers</a> 
  command allows the additional of pluggable modules that know how to &quot;speak&quot; 
  to the vendors server. By default, jmxcmd supports the standard JMXMP Connector.</p>

<h2>3. Other Issues</h2>
<p>The following sections discuss commonly asked questions or concerns.</p>
<h3>3.1 Startup performance</h3>
<p>See the discussion of <a href="./jcmd-index.html#StartupPerformance">startup 
  performance for jcmd</a>. As jmxcmd is based on <a href="./jcmd-index.html">jcmd</a>, 
  its startup performance is largely the same as jcmd. </p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="./jcmd-index.html">jcmd</a>, most jmxcmd commands 
  need to establish a network connection to an MBeanServer. In most cases, this 
  cost is minimal and can be ignored for practical purposes. However, if SSL/TLS 
  is being employed, the cost (especially in pure Java) can be substantial--on 
  the order of 3-4X the startup time which can amount to 3 or 4 seconds or more 
  on slow machines. As with jcmd, using interactive mode or the <a href="./jcmd-commands.html#source">source</a> 
  command eliminates this as an issue. But if jmxcmd is being started for each 
  individual command, then the performance can become a real issue. Let us now 
  discuss how to eliminate this performance bottleneck.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Eliminating SSL/TLS connection speed as a performance bottleneck</h4>
<p>The technique suggested in this section is to use jmxcmd as a proxy server, 
  which will run without quitting, thus keeping alive the expensive SSL/TLS-based 
  connections.</p>
<p>Here is how to use jmxcmd as a proxy server::</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">jmxcmd&gt; start-mbean-server 
  my-server<br>
  MBean server my-server started.<br>
  jmxcmd&gt; connect my-server<br>
  Connection my-server (mbeanserver=my-server,PROTOCOL=inprocess) is now the active 
  connection<br>
  jmxcmd&gt; load-jmxmp-connector --port 9998<br>
  Loaded and started connector: connector:name=jmxmp-connector-server,type=connector,port=9998<br>
  </font></p>
<p>At this point, jmxcmd is now running as a server with the standard jmxmp-based 
  connector listening on port 9998. You may continue to use jmxcmd as usual while 
  it is active as a server. The next step is to create proxies within the newly-created 
  MBeanServer &quot;my-server&quot;. These proxies may refer to one or more MBeans 
  in one or more MBean servers using one or more protocols. Refer to the <a href="./jmxcmd-commands.html#create-proxies">create-proxies</a> 
  command for information on how to specify and create proxies. Because this instance 
  of jmxcmd does not quit, the connections to these other servers stay alive, 
  thus eliminating any overhead. Most likely if you want to use such a setup, 
  you will want to place all the setup commands in a file which can be executed 
  using the <a href="./jcmd-commands-index.html#source">source</a> command:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">jmxcmd&gt; source my-server-setup.jmxcmd</font></p>
<p>Presumably you went to this trouble so that you could issue single commands 
  from your command shell or script without the SSL connection overhead. You would 
  now proceed as follows:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">% jmxcmd connect --port 9998 
  my-server<br>
  Connection my-server (PROTOCOL=jmxmp,HOST=localhost,PORT=9998) is now the active 
  connection<br>
  % jmxcmd find *<br>
  connector:name=jmxmp-connector-server,type=connector,port=9998<br>
  JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate</font></p>
