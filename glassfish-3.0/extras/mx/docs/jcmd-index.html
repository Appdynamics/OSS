<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>JCmd ('jcmd') is an all-Java command line interface shell. It supports the 
  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a powerful framework for implementing commands</li>
  <li>an extensible (pluggable) command set based on a developer-selectable mix 
    of built-in and pluggable comands </li>
  <li>a CLI compliant with SUSv3 and Sun Microsystems CLIP standards</li>
  <li>invocation either from a command shell or in interactive mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="./javadoc/index.html">Javadoc</a> is available. If you are interested 
  in adding or removing commands from JCmd, see the optional facilities <a href="./jcmd-optional.html">documentation</a>.If 
  you want to build your own command line, see the <a href="./build-your-own.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Overview</h2>
<p>The following sections discuss some key concepts used by jcmd which should 
  be understood to use it effectively.</p>
<h3>2.1 JCmd command shell<a name="jmxcmdShell"></a></h3>
<p>JCmd may be invoked either conventionally via one's usual command shell, or 
  in an interactive mode. Example:</p>
<p><i>Single invocation</i>:</p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">bash-2.05$ jcmd help<br>
  ...</font></p>
<p><i>Interactive mode</i>:<a name="InteractiveMode"></a></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">bash-2.05$ jcmd<br>
  jmxcmd&gt; help<br>
  ...</font></p>
<p>State is saved by jcmd in the user's home directory. State includes the jcmd 
  environment variables as well as the command history.</p>
<p>Most commands have abbreviations available; refer to the help for each command. 
  All commands have both long and short names for command options (if any).</p>
<h3> 2.2 Startup performance<a name="StartupPerformance"></a></h3>
<p>Many command-line users are concerned about the startup-time penalty of using 
  a Java-based CLI. Compared to a C-based executable, Java is relatively slow. 
  The startup of jcmd should be comparable to starting up a java &quot;hello world&quot; 
  application. </p>
<p>The JCmd framework further mitigates this problem in several ways.</p>
<p>(1) Where possible, &quot;lazy&quot; initialization is performed. The assumption 
  is that only a minor portion of the facilities may be used, so no advance initialization 
  is used, nor is the base architecture dependent on large numbers of classes.</p>
<p>(2) Complex, CPU-intensive initialization is avoided by avoiding the use of 
  complex configuration (eg XML), which can consume substantial amounts of CPU 
  time to parse.</p>
<p>(3) When multiple commands are to be issued interactively, the user may start 
  the CLI once, and issue multiple commands (<a href="#InteractiveMode">interactive 
  mode</a>). In such a case, the startup overhead becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>(4) When multiple commands are to be issued programmatically, they may be grouped 
  into a file, and the <a href="./jcmd-commands.html#source">source</a> command 
  may be used to execute them. In this case, there is only one startup of jcmd 
  for the entire lifecycle of the source command, which could execute an arbitrary 
  number of commands.</p>
