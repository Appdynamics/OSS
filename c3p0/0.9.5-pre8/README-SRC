Hi.

Building c3p0 should be as easy as editing build.properties and typing ant.

  *****************************************************************************
  * NOTE: This version of c3p0 supports the JDBC 3 spec, not JDBC 4, and must *
  *       be built under JDK 1.5 (or 1.4, with some tweaking). The next major *
  *       version of c3p0 will support JDBC 4 and JDK 1.6+, but we're not     *
  *       there yet.                                                          *
  *****************************************************************************

There is a dependency: You'll need an mchange-commons-java jar file, which is bundled
in the lib directory of c3p0's binary distribution as a convenience. 

Development snapshots and source for c3p0 are available on github as..

Development snapshots and source for mchange-commons-java is also available on github...

Please send any feedback / questions to Steve Waldman <swaldman@mchange.com>

All of the test related properties are very optional. There are various
test tasks in the build file, but they are ad-hoc and unsupported.
