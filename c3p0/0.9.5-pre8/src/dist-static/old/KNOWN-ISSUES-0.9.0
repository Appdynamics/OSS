As of release, the following issues have been reported, but have not been understood or resolved
to the satisfaction of the developers.  All of these are issues that the developers have not been
able to reproduce, making them hard to fix. Any help in tracking down these problems would be 
greatly appreciated.

Known Issues
============

	RARE reports of InterruptedException on client threads, especially at database recovery

	   + Two users have reported observing InterruptedExceptions on client threads, one upon 
	     database recovery after an outage and one upon trying to acquire a cached PreparedStatement.
	     c3p0 does not call interrup() on client Threads, except for Threads wait()ing for
	     Connections in a pool that is close()ing. The reported Exceptions do not involve a pool
	     close(). It may be that some non-c3p0 is interruting() these Threads, and c3p0 is
	     simply the first library to react to the interrupted state. [Thanks to Scott Russell and
	     Pkumar for these reports.]

	RARE reports of retention of closed Connections:

	   + One user has documented retention of Connections for some time after they have been
	     closed. He tracked the problem down to a retained reference in the Thread Pool's
	     deadlock detector. This reference is now nulled out early, and there have been no 
	     further reports of prolonged retention, but the cause of the original apparent retention 
	     has not been adequately explained. [Thanks to Venkatesh Seetharamaiah for this report.]

	RARE reports c3p0/jTDS deadlocks:

	   + Although most c3p0/jTDS issues have been resolved as of this release of c3p0 and
    	     the latest release of jTDS (thanks guys!), there is at least one outstanding report
	     of an unexplained deadlock when c3p0 attempts to close pooled jTDS Connnections. (These 
	     appear as occasional "APPARENT DEADLOCK" dumps at WARN level to whatever logger is
	     in use. We believe that most c3p0/jTDS users do NOT experience this issue, and are
	     eager for further reports or feedback of any sort that might shed light upon the
	     problem. [Thanks to Guillaume Chevallier for this report.]

	     (Users who experience this problem may resolve it by turning off statement caching,
	     but we'd prefer you give us more information about what went wrong so we can resolve
	     the problem if you experience this issue.)
