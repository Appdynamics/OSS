-- in-use locking of NewPooledConnections ResourcePool.Manager tasks in C3P0PooledConnectionPool is 
   unnecessary and hard to reason aboout in light of NewPooledConnection locks, pool semantics
   enforce exclusive use by maintenance tasks, there is no need to re-enforce exclusive access at all
   [???]

-- it would be insanely easy to get rid of the recursiveness in BasicResourcePool.checkoutResource( ... ).
   worth doing? it's tail-recursive, best to just wait 'til that's optimized in Java?

-- Deserialization of all IdentityTokenized should readResolve() to ensure
   that either already C3P0Registry-registered IdenityTokenizeds are used,
   or if unavailable, the nascent Object registers. ConnectionTesters should also
   be coalesced if possible. (Delayed to 0.9.6... although more correct, it's possible
   (but unlikely) this might break something, and I want 0.9.5 out the door already.)
