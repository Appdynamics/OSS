<p>The Java API for RESTful Web Services provides portable APIs for developing, exposing and accessing
    Web applications designed and implemented in compliance with principles of REST architectural style.</p>

<h2>Web resources</h2>

<p>JAX-RS core APIs enable developers to rapidly build Web applications in Java that are characteristic
    of the best designed parts of the Web. The API brings in support for designing and implementing
    Web resources and application that follow principles of
    <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">REST (Representational
        State Transfer)</a> architectural style to the Java Platform.</p>

<p>In JAX-RS, Java POJOs can be exposed as RESTful Web resources independent of the underlying technology
    using a high level easy-to-use declarative annotation-based API. E.g.:</p>

<pre>
&#64;Path("widgets/{widgetid}")
&#64;Consumes("application/widgets+xml")
&#64;Produces("application/widgets+xml")
public class WidgetResource {

    &#64;GET
    public String getWidget(&#64;PathParam("widgetid") String id) {
        return getWidgetAsXml(id);
    }

    &#64;PUT
    public void updateWidget(&#64;PathParam("widgetid") String id,
                             Source update) {
       updateWidgetFromXml(id, update);
    }

    ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Web resource clients</h2>

<p>JAX-RS client API is a Java based API used to access resources on the Web. It is not restricted
    to resources implemented using JAX-RS. It provides a higher-level abstraction compared to a
    {@link java.net.HttpURLConnection plain HTTP communication API} as well as integration with the
    JAX-RS extension providers, in order to enable concise and efficient implementation of
    reusable client-side solutions that leverage existing and well
    established client-side implementations of HTTP-based communication.</p>

<p>The JAX-RS Client API also encapsulates the Uniform Interface Constraint &ndash;
    a key constraint of the REST architectural style &ndash; and associated data
    elements as client-side Java artifacts and supports a pluggable architecture
    by defining multiple extension points.</p>

<p>Following example demonstrates a simple JAX-RS client API usage scenario:</p>

<pre>
    Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();

    client.property("MyProperty", "MyValue")
          .register(MyProvider.class)
          .enable(MyFeature.class);

    Response res = client.target("http://example.org/hello").request("text/plain").get();
    String message = res.readEntity(String.class);
 </pre>

<h2>Provider extensions</h2>

<p>JAX-RS applications may provide custom extensions to the client and server runtime using the
    common extension APIs defined in <a href="javax/ws/rs/ext/package-summary.html">javax.ws.rs.ext</a>
    package, namely entity providers and entity provider interceptors. Additionally, request and
    response processing chains on client as well as server side can be further customized by
    implemening custom request and response filters - see the
    <a href="javax/ws/rs/client/ClientRequestFilter.html">ClientRequestFilter</a>,
    <a href="javax/ws/rs/client/ClientResponseFilter.html">ClientResponseFilter</a>,
    <a href="javax/ws/rs/container/ContainerRequestFilter.html">ContainerRequestFilter</a>,
    <a href="javax/ws/rs/container/ContainerResponseFilter.html">ContainerResponseFilter</a>
    APIs.</p>
