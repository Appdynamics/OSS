/**
 * This interface should be implemented in order to provide
 * a factory for another type.  This is useful when the type
 * has some reason that it cannot be a created in the usual way.
 * <p>
 * A factory may not have a TypeVariable or a Wildcard as its
 * actual type.  A factory may have any scope, and the scope
 * of the factory is independent of the scope of the type it
 * is providing.
 * <p>
 * The scope and qualifiers of the objects this factory is producing
 * must be placed on the provide method itself.  Objects created with
 * this method will be put into the scope on the provide method, and
 * will have the qualifiers of the provide method.
 * <p>
 * A factory is generally added with the {@link FactoryDescriptors} helper
 * class, though factories can also be registered independently.
 * <p>
 * A Factory implementation may inject a {@link InstantiationService}.  If
 * it does so then the {@link InstantiationService#getInstantiationData()} method
 * will return information about the caller of the provide method if that
 * information is available.  This can be used to customize the returned object
 * based on the Injection point of the parent.
 * 
 * @author jwells
 * @param <T> This must be the type of entity for which this is a factory.
 * For example, if this were a factory for Foo, then your factory
 * must implement Factory&lt;Foo&gt;.
