/**
 * When HK2 automatically analyzes a class to find the constructor, fields,
 * initializer methods and postConstruct and preDestroy methods it uses this
 * service to analyze the class.  This analyzer is only used for descriptors
 * that are not pre-reified and which are not provided by factories.
 * <p>
 * HK2 will provide a default implementation of this service (with the name
 * &quot;default&quot;).  However, individual descriptors may choose a different class
 * analyzer should they so choose.  All user supplied implementations of this
 * service must have a name.  Implementations of this service must not be ClassAnalyzers
 * for themselves.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link ServiceLocator#setDefaultClassAnalyzerName(String)} can be used
 * to set the global ClassAnalyzer name that will be the name of the ClassAnalyzer used
 * when the method {@link Descriptor#getClassAnalysisName()} returns null
 * <p>
 * Implementations of ClassAnalyzer will be instantiated as soon as
 * they are added to HK2 in order to avoid deadlocks and circular references.
 * Therefore it is recommended that implementations of ClassAnalyzer
 * make liberal use of {@link javax.inject.Provider} or {@link IterableProvider}
 * when injecting dependent services so that these services are not instantiated
 * when the ClassAnalyzer is created
