/**
 * ServiceLocator is the registry for HK2 services
 * <p>
 * This service is the most fundamental service in an HK2 system.  Every
 * service locator starts with a ServiceLocator as a service, and hence
 * ServiceLocators can be injected into every object managed by HK2.
 * <p>
 * A service locator can have a single parent.  Services are looked up in
 * the current service locator and in all the parents of the service locator.
 * If multiple services exist that match the filter they will all be returned.
 * Two services with the same priority are sorted first by service locator
 * id and second by service id.  This implies that services directly installed
 * in a ServiceLocator have higher natural priority than those in the parents
 * of the ServiceLocator.  Services can also be marked as having visibility LOCAL,
 * in which case they will only be available to the ServiceLocator performing
 * the lookup, and will not leak out to children of that ServiceLocator.
