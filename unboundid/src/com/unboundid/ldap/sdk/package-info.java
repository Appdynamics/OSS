/**
 * This package contains classes which may be used to communicate with an LDAP
 * directory server.  The {@code LDAPConnection} and {@code LDAPConnectionPool}
 * classes provide the primary means for interacting with directory servers, and
 * both implement the {@code LDAPInterface} interface which can be used to allow
 * connections and connection pools to be used interchangeably for most types of
 * operations.  Other classes in this package provide data structures to assist
 * in LDAP communication.  Most request types are mutable, so that they can be
 * altered and re-used.
