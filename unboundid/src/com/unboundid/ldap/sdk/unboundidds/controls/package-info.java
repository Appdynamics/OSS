/**
 * This package contains implementations for a number of LDAP controls which are
 * specific to the Ping Identity, UnboundID, and Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661
 * Directory Server products.  In some cases, they may be based on standard
 * controls which have not yet reached a sufficient stability level to make them
 * available for general use against any kind of server, while in other cases
 * they may be defined specifically for use with the Ping Identity, UnboundID,
 * and Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory Server.
 * <BR>
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 *   <B>NOTE:</B>  The classes within this package, and elsewhere within the
 *   {@code com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.unboundidds} package structure, are only
 *   supported for use against Ping Identity, UnboundID, and
 *   Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 server products.  These classes provide support
 *   for proprietary functionality or for external specifications that are not
 *   considered stable or mature enough to be guaranteed to work in an
 *   interoperable way with other types of LDAP servers.
