 * timeout because this method cannot be used with some socket factories (like
 * SSL socket factories), and that method is also not reliable for hung servers
 * which are listening for connections but are not responsive.  The
 * {@link #getConnectedSocket} method should be called immediately after
 * starting the thread to wait for the connection to be established, or to fail
 * if it cannot be successfully established within the given timeout period.
