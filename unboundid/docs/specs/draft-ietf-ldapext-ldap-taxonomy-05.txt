Abstract

   There are several different methods for a LDAP client to find a LDAP
   server. This draft discusses these methods and provides pointers for
   interested parties to learn more about implementing a particular
   method.

1. Introduction

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] can be used to
   build "islands" of servers that are not a priori tied into a single
   Directory Information Tree (DIT.) Here, it is necessary to determine
   how a client can discover LDAP servers. This documents discusses the
   currently available methods and provides pointers for interested
   parties to learn more about implementing a particular method.

   This draft documents only those methods that are currently being
   pursued in the IETF.  Other methods have been considered for this

   problem and the history of these other methods are presented in the
   Appendix.

2. Methods

2.1 Client Configuration

   The simplest method of enabling a LDAP client to discover LDAP
   servers is for the client administrator to configure the client with
   a list of known LDAP servers (and associated base objects) to send
   queries to.  While this method has the advantage of being correct
   (initially), it adds the requirement that the list of initial servers
   be kept small and constant.  Otherwise, the required client update
   process won't scale.

2.2 Well known DNS aliases

   If the DIT uses a naming scheme similar to that in RFC 2377 [2], then
   it is possible to build the DNS names of potential servers using well
   known DNS aliases, like those documented in RFC 2219 [3].  When a
   different naming scheme is used, it is also possible to build
   potential server names based on the client's fully qualified domain
   name or local (within the organization or country) environment.

   One shortcoming of this method are that it is not exact.  Multiple
   DNS lookups and LDAP protocol operations may be necessary to find the
   proper LDAP server to serve the client requests.  To support client
   roaming, it is necessary that either the RFC 2377 (or similar) naming
   scheme be used or that roaming be implemented through tunnels.

   Because this method uses DNS, it inherits all the security
   considerations of using DNS to discover LDAP servers: see the
   security consideration in [3] for more details.

2.3 Service Location Protocol

   If a client supports the service location protocol [4], it could use
   a SLP query for LDAP servers.  The SLP template that is used to
   describe LDAP servers is presented in [5], and requires that the
   servers announce themselves using SLP and this template.

   Using this method inherits the scaling and security considerations
   for the service location protocol, which are documented further in
   [4].

2.4 Referrals

   In LDAPv3, servers can return referrals to the client if the server
   has knowledge of where a query might be satisfiable.  Two ways of
   deploying referral information are deploying a LDAP knowledge server
   or exchanging CIP index objects [6] between servers.

   A LDAP knowledge server would hold cross references to possibly
   hundreds of other LDAP  servers, so that a client would only need to
   know about its local LDAP server and the knowledge server.  As an
   optimization, the local LDAP server could also act as a knowledge
   server.

   If CIP index objects are exchanged between LDAP servers, then those
   objects can also carry URL information for providing referrals to
   clients. Here, the client would only need to know about the local
   server. Using CIP index objects inherits the security considerations
   of CIP: see [6, 7, 8] for more details.

   In either of these cases, the local LDAP server could be determined
   using another of the methods discussed.

2.5 Using SRV records

   RFC 2052 [12] defined SRV records for DNS, which bound a host name
   and port to a label in the DNS. This makes it possible for a client
   to look up information about a supported protocol for a domain and
   get back a  weighted list of fully qualified domain names and ports
   for where that protocol is supported.  For more information, see
   [13].

3. Implementation

   The Norwegian Directory Forum plans to start a service based on a
   central LDAP service containing contact information for every
   organization within Norway [10]. If an organization has more
   information about its sub-units, employees or functions that it wants
   to publish it can do so by placing this information in a publicly
   available LDAP server and providing the management of the central
   service with a pointer (URL) to this server.

   The TISDAG project is running a test service based on the TISDAG
   specification [11]. This service gathers indices from connected White
   Pages Service Providers using CIP Tagged Index Objects [9].  The
   rationale for this service is that by supplying the name of a person
   or a function/role to the service it will return pointers to where
   more information can be found about persons/functions with that name.

   The European cofunded project DESIRE (www.desire.org) is designing a
   system to use a LDAP server that communicates with a referral index
   that in turn, uses CIP Tagged Index Objects [9] and is fed by LDAP
   crawlers.  DANTE plans to set up a European infrastructure of such
   referral index servers.

Appendix A. Historical Methods

A.1 Discovery

   The discovery approach was to use a combination of other methods pre-
   sented in this taxonomy along with storing either the search DN or a
   related URL in the DNS in some way.  Using both TXT or NAPTR records
   in the DNS were considered.  This approach requires an administrator
   to configure the DNS with necessary information.  Further, the idea
   of storing standards based information (either a DN or an URL) in a
   DNS RR has been an extremely controversial one in the IETF.

A.2 DHCP extensions

   Another proposed method was to use DHCP to deliver information about
   LDAP server to a DHCP client. This would require that such informa-
   tion be configured into the DHCP server and that the client use DHCP
   to load host configuration information. While there has been some
   nascent interest in this method, there has been no interest in imple-
   mentation of this approach.
