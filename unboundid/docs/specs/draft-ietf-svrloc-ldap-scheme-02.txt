Abstract

   This document describes the LDAP service type. This service type
   defines the service: URL and attributes necessary for discovering
   LDAP servers.

1. Introduction

   This document describes a template providing a service: URL and
   attributes useful for dynamically discovering LDAP servers; this type
   can be used with SLP [1]. Service templates and service: schemes are
   defined in [2].

   LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) [3] directories are

   now being used as repositories for UNIX-style system information.
   As such, LDAP service is suitable to be included in the naming-
   directory class. This type is intended to be used as a concrete
   portion of the abstract naming-directory type defined in [4]. The
   LDAP type includes all attributes from the naming-directory abstract
   type, and defines new attributes pertaining to security and access
   protocols.

   For usage examples for non-LDAP specific scenarios, refer to [4].

2. Differentiating Servers by Authentication Mechanisms

   Possible means of authenticating LDAP transactions are defined
   in [5]. In order to agree on a particular authentication mechanism,
   a client and server might need to go through a number of iterations
   and levels of negotiation. Currently there are three levels of
   mechanisms: The first level consists of the basic mechanisms,
   anonymous, simple, and TLS. The second layer consists of the SASL
   negotiation layer [6]. The third layer consists of GSSAPI [7]
   mechanisms, and possible the GSS-SPNEGO negotiation sequence [8].
   Thus it is possible that a client wishing to use the Kerberos V5
   GSSAPI mechanism may need to negotiate its way through SASL and
   GSS-SPNEGO before coming to an agreement with the server.

   Since LDAP clients are already aware of what mechanisms they have
   been configured to use when connecting to an LDAP server, the
   attributes in this template have been designed to allow clients to
   optimize both their search for servers and the following negotiation
   sequence for authentication mechanisms. Clients may specify as
   little or as much of their desired negotiation path. For example,
   all of the following SLP [1] search filters are valid:

   (security=sasl)

   (&(security=sasl)(|(sasl-mechs=cram-md5)(sasl-mechs=external)))

   (&(security=sasl)(sasl-mechs=GSSAPI)(gss-mechs=1.3.5.1.5.2))

   The more fully a client specifies the negotiation path, the greater
   the likelihood that the client will discover a server which
   supports the same mechanisms as the client. If a server does not
   support the required mechanisms, clients will need to move on to
   other discovered servers, and repeat the negotiation process. This
   can be a costly process. Additionally, clients should be able to
   optimize the resulting negotiation, bypassing mechanisms which are
   not acceptable to one of the parties.

   The allowable values for the "security" attribute follows those

   defined in [5].

   The allowable values for the "sasl-mechs" and "gss-mechs"
   attributes are meant to be fluid, following the decisions of their
   respective working groups.

Language of service template: en
Security Considerations:
  This LDAP service type inherits the security considerations from the
  naming-directory service type [4], the SLP specification [1].
  Implementors should also be aware of the security considerations
  discussed in [5].

  This is a concrete type; the abstract type for this service

  by LDAP servers to advertise their services and LDAP clients
  which wish to discover LDAP servers.

  url-path = ldap URL as defined in [9]

security=string M
  # Security mechanisms supported by this server. Permitted values

  # SASL mechanisms supported by this server. If the GSSAPI or GSS-SPNEGO
  # mechanisms are supported, clients may further differentiate servers
  # with the gss-mechs attribute. SASL mechanisms are registered with

  # This is an open-ended attribute intended to contain any standard or
