The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Content Synchronization
                      Operation with Transactions
              draft-spacek-ldapext-syncrepl-transaction-01

Abstract

   This document specifies LDAP Control which extends the persist stage
   of the Content Synchronization Operation with information about LDAP
   transaction boundaries.  This information can be used to support
   application-level transactions or for application-level
   optimizations.

1.  Introduction

   The LDAP Content Synchronization Operation [RFC4533] and LDAP
   Transactions [RFC5805] are not integrated, which makes the Content
   Synchronization Operation less useful.

   The client using the Content Synchronization Operation has no
   information of which changes were part of a single transaction.  As a
   result, the client cannot replicate transaction semantics reliably,
   especially when a connection to an LDAP server is interrupted in the
   middle of the persist stage of the Content Synchronization Operation.

   Some clients could use the information where an LDAP transaction
   started and ended for transactions at application level to guarantee
   consistency of application data.  Altenatively, some applications can
   use transaction boundaries for optimizations when further processing
   of the data is triggered by the end of a transaction.  This might
   allow the application to save some overhead by processing changes in
   groups.

2.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Term "transaction identifier" has the same definition as in
   [RFC5805].

3.  Elements of the LDAP Content Synchronization with Transactions

   Existing protocol messages and semantics defined by [RFC4533] are not
   changed.  The protocol flow is only extended with Transaction
   Notification Control, Start, and End Transaction Notification
   Messages.

3.1.  Transaction Notification Control

   The Transaction Notification Control is an LDAPControl [RFC4511]
   where the controlType is "TBD1" and the controlValue is absent.  The
   criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.

3.2.  Start Transaction Notification Message

   The Start Transaction Notification message is an IntermediateResponse
   [RFC4511] where the responseName is "TBD2" and the responseValue is
   absent.

3.3.  End Transaction Notification Message

   The End Transaction Notification message is an IntermediateResponse
   [RFC4511] where the responseName is "TBD3" and the responseValue is
   absent.

4.  Interaction with the Content Synchronization Operation

   The client requests information about LDAP Transaction to be added to
   the Content Synchronization Operation by sending Transaction
   Notification Control along with a SearchRequest Message that contains
   a Sync Request Control [RFC4533].  All attempts to use Transaction
   Notification Control without Sync Request Control MUST be denied with
   the unwillingToPerform [RFC4511] result code.

   TODO: THIS SHOULD BE CLARIFIED BY FURTHER UPDATES TO TRANSACTION RFCs

   Please note that [RFC5805] defined that LDAP Transactions have
   atomic, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties without
   further specification of the "isolation" level.  This extension

   assumes that an isolation property guarantees that uncommited changes
   are generaly not visible to LDAP clients and thus not returned in the
   Content Synchronization Operation results.

4.1.  Refresh stage

   The refresh stage of the Content Synchronization Operation is
   unaffected by Transaction Notification Control.  The control affects
   neither Content Determination nor protocol messages sent during the
   refresh stage.

   Transaction-aware clients MUST treat the refresh stage as a single
   transaction.  Messages that mark end of the refresh stage are defined
   in [RFC4533].

4.2.  Persist stage

   Existing protocol messages and semantics defined by [RFC4533] are not
   changed.  The protocol flow in the persist stage is extended only
   with Start and End Transaction Notification Messages.

   A Start Transaction Notification Message MUST be sent to a client
   when a transaction is successfully commited but before any of the
   changes contained in the transaction are sent to the client.

   The Start Transaction Notification Message MUST be followed by all
   Change notification messages as defined in the persist stage of
   [RFC4533].  A server MUST NOT interleave changes made in multiple
   transactions to ensure that Start and End messages unambiguously
   identify one transaction.

   An End Transaction Notification Message MUST be sent immediatelly
   after all Change notifications for given transaction were sent to the
   client.  This message signalizes to the client that the transaction
   marked by the Start Transaction Notification Message is complete and
   all changes can be commited.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

6.  Security Considerations

   This document merely adds information about transaction boundaries to
   the existing Content Synchronization Operation.  This is believed not
   to add any security risk.
