2. Abstract

   This document defines a LDAPv3 [2] control to be used on the Search 
   Request to allow a client to retrieve information on changes which
   are made to the directory information tree held by that server. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3. Definition of control sent by client

   A client may provide a control of a particular type when invoking
   a search request.

   The controlType is "1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.29539.10", the criticality 
   field may be TRUE or FALSE, and the controlValue field is absent.

   The search request size and time limits SHOULD both be 0.

   The server will return SearchResultEntry responses for all entries
   which match the client's search filter.  However, the server will
   not return a SearchResultDone as it would normally.

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAPv3 Triggered Search Control       August 1998

   Instead, the server will preserve the client's message id, search 
   filter and requested attribute list and associate it with the
   client's connection and this message id.

   The server will only return the SearchResultDone if there is an error 
   condition (e.g. unwillingToPerform), and will not return the
   SearchResultDone if the request was successful.

   So long as the connection to the client is open and the client does 
   not abandon the request or reuse the request message id, the server
   will return additional SearchResultEntry responses as entry
   addition, deletions and modifications occur resulting in entries
   which match the search.  These responses have the same message id 
   as the original request.

   The client may terminate the return of responses by abandoning the 
   request.

4. Using the control in a naming context other than the changelog

   The client can use this control when performing a search of all or
   part of one or more naming contexts.  When the naming context is not 
   the change log [3], the server includes a control defined in 
   section 4.1 with each SearchResultEntry returned by the server.

   The entries in the naming contexts to which the client has access,
   are in the scope of the search and match the filter are termed the
   result set.

   As entries enter the result set, leave the result set, or are 
   modified in place, then an additional SearchResultEntry is
   returned to the client.

   An entry can enter the result set for the following reasons:
    - a new entry is added which matches the scope and filter,
    - an entry which did not match the filter is modified to add 
      attributes which cause it to now match the filter, 
    - an entry which matches the filter but was outside of the 
      scope is renamed (or one of its superior entries is renamed)
      so that it is now in scope, or
    - a change to access control or other administrative function
      cause an entry which matches the scope and filter to be
      visible to the client.

   An entry can leave the result set for the following reasons:
    - an entry which matched the scope and filter is deleted,
    - an entry which matched the scope and filter is modified so
      that it no longer matches the filter,
    - an entry which matched the scope and filter is renamed (or
      one of its superior entries is renamed) so that it is no 
      longer in scope,

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAPv3 Triggered Search Control       August 1998

    - a change to access control or other administrative function
      cause an entry which was visible to the client and matched
      the scope and filter to no longer be visible, and the resulting
      access control allows the client to be notified of this.

4.1. Definition of control returned by server

   The controlType is 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.29539.13, the criticality
   is TRUE, and the controlValue contains the bytes of the 
   BER-encoding of the following ASN.1 type:

      TriggerResultControl ::= SEQUENCE {
        resultType ENUMERATED {
          notChange     (0),
          enteredSet    (1),
          leftSet       (2),
          modified      (3) },
        [1] changeType LDAPString OPTIONAL,
        [2] previousDN LDAPDN OPTIONAL,
        [3] changeNumber LDAPString OPTIONAL }

   The resultType is defined as follows:
     - notChange: the entry existed in the directory and matched
       the search at the time the operation is being performed,
     - enteredSet: the entry entered the result set for one of the
       reasons defined in section 4 above,
     - leftSet: the entry left the result set for one of the
       reasons defined in section 4 above,
     - modified: the entry was part of the result set, was 
       modified or renamed, and still is in the result set.
   
   The changeType field is as defined to have the same value as
   the changeType attribute in the change log, such as "add", "delete",
   "modify" or "modrdn".

   If the changeType is "modrdn", then the previousDN field contains 
   the name of the entry before the rename.

   The changeNumber is defined to have the same value as the 
   changeNumber attribute in the change log: the string representation 
   of change number assigned by the server for the change.  It SHOULD 
   be present if the server supports the change log.  

4.2. Example
 
   To be provided in a later revision of this draft.

5. Using the triggered search control in the changelog

   The client can also use this control when performing a search
   of the change log [3].  In this case, the search request MUST 
   have the baseObject field set to the name of the base of the 
   server's change log and the scope MUST be either singleLevel or 
   wholeSubtree.

5.1. Example

   To be provided in a later revision of this draft.

5.2. Matching Rule

   A matching rule is defined to allow the client to request changes from
   only a particular portion of the tree when using the changelog.

   A server will advertise support for this matching rule by having the 
   following rule definition present in the subschema subentry governing
   the changelog.  (A client can determine the subschema subentry for the
   changelog by retrieving the attribute subschemaSubentry from the base 
   entry of the changelog.)

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.29539.10.1 NAME 'dnSubordinateTo' 
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 )

   An extensibleMatch filter will evaluate to TRUE for an entry to which 
   the client has access if the matchingRule field is 
   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.29539.10.1, the type field is any attribute with DN 
   syntax (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12), and there is a value of that 
   attribute present in an entry which is the same as or subordinate to
   the matchValue field.
   
   For example, if a client presented the following filter:

   (targetDN:1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.29539.10.1:=dc=acme,dc=com) 

   the filter would evaluate as follows for the following values, 
   assuming the client had sufficient access rights to perform the 
   filtering:

   targetDn: dc=org                            FALSE
   targetDn: dc=com                            FALSE
   targetDn: dc=acme,dc=com                    TRUE
   targetDn: dc=www,dc=acme,dc=com             TRUE
   targetDn: dc=www,dc=acme,dc=com,dc=sg       FALSE
   targetDn: cn=server,dc=www,dc=acme,dc=com   TRUE

6. Scaling Considerations 

   The use of this control may greatly increase the amount of server
   processing for modification operations, as well as the amount of 
   network traffic as clients are notified of changes.  Server 
   implementations used on the Internet MUST have support 
   administrative restrictions on the use of search triggers.

7. Security Considerations

   The changes attribute of the change log entries should not be 
   generally readable.  The administrator will typically configure 
   specific users who are authorized to retrieve this attribute.
