Abstract

   This document defines an 'namedObject' structural object class for
   the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500.  This is
   useful for entries with no natural choice of structural object class,

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP object class 'untypedObject'          June 2006


1. Introduction

   An entry in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPV3]
   or [X.500] directory must have a structural object class, such as
   'person' or 'country'.  However, an entry may lack a natural choice
   of structural object class.  For example, the desired structure of a
   directory tree might require an entry to exist for grouping purposes
   even though it describes no real-world object.  This document defines
   an 'namedObject' structural object class for this use.

   As 'namedObject' structural object class doesn't have any mandatory
   attributes, it can also be used in combination with arbitrary
   auxiliary object classes.  For example, the posixGroup object class
   [LDAP-NIS] is an auxiliary object class that may be used to overlay
   POSIX group identification on an existing group of distinguished
   names.  In this case, it is suggested that the groupOfUniqueNames
   object class be used as a structural object class. However, this may
   sometimes be inappropriate: that groupOfUniqueNames requires at least
   one member may make it impossible to migrate existing group
   information. [LDAP-NIS] could define a specific structural object
   class for this case (say, structuralPosixGroup), but this would
   unnecessarily add to the proliferation of redundant schema.


2. Object class definition

   namedObject is defined as follows.  The definition uses the BNF form
   of ObjectClassDescription from [MODEL], but with lines folded for
   readability.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID NAME 'namedObject'
        DESC 'Entry of no particular type [RFC XXXX]'
        SUP top STRUCTURAL
        MAY ( cn $ o $ ou $ l $ c $ st $ street $
              description $ owner $ seeAlso ) )

   <<Reuse Luke's OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.13.1.1?>>

   The attribute types are defined in [SCHEMA].

   The name of an entry with this object class will normally be a cn,
   but attributes o through street are allowed as well in case the entry
   name relates to the name of something else.  Of these, only the one
   used for naming is intended to be used in the entry.  Use of the
   others may be an indication that the entry should have a more
   descriptive object class instead of or in addition to this one.

3. Example

   In a directory with entries named as follows, the entries with RDNs
   cn=people etc. can use namedObject:

                  uid=john,cn=people,dc=example,dc=com
         uid=john,cn=users,cn=system,dc=example,dc=com
      cn=www,cn=filegroups,cn=system,dc=example,dc=com


4. Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   <<TBD>>


5. IANA Considerations

   It is requested that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   register the following upon Expert Review:

      Subject: Request for LDAP OID Registration
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
         Hallvard B Furuseth <h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no>
      Specification: RFC XXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG
      Comments:
         OID of structural object class 'namedObject'.

      Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
      Descriptor (short name): namedObject
      Object Identifier: IANA-ASSIGNED-OID
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
         Luke Howard <lukeh@padl.com>
      Usage: Object class
      Specification: RFC XXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG
      Comments:
         Structural object class for entries of no particular type.

   [Editor: Here and in Section 2, replace IANA-ASSIGNED-OID with the
   assigned OID and XXXX with the RFC number assigned this document.]

Appendix A: Notes on choices made for the object class

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   The c through uid attributes (for naming of entries) match the table
   of naming attributes in [STRING-DN] (UTF-8 String Representation of
   Distinguished Names), in case the entry's RDN needs to match the RDN
   of something else.

   The description, owner and seeAlso attributes seem good to offer for
   "nothing in particular"-kind of entries, since such entries might not
   contain anything else which indicates what they are for and who is
   responsible for them.


Appendix B: Issues for consideration

   (This section will be deleted in the final RFC.)

   Is the name of this object class properly reflects its purpose?

   Is the choice of naming attributes good?
