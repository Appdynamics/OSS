2.  Abstract

This document describes an LDAP schema for the attributes to be included
in the standard phone book.  Goals of this document include:

   - Creating a flexible, extensible and robust framework
     upon which to build a standard phone book
   - Promoting a standard phone book format, to enhance
     interoperability between ISPs and roaming consortia

Non-goals of this document include:

   - Attempting to create a ''Swiss army knife'', with phone
     book attributes to please everyone on Earth
   - Definition of either server-server or client-server
     phone book update or transfer protocols

Internet-Draft           LDAP Phone Book Schema            November 1997


3.  Rationale for LDAP Usage

The attributes are defined in terms that  are  directly  usable  by  the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for several reasons:

   - Extensibility
   - Flexibility
   - Integration with LDAP-based Directory

Extensibility  is important because phone books are living documents; as
such, it is unlikely that all the  semantic  requirements  of  arbitrary
Internet  service  providers  (ISPs)  would be met by a fixed scheme, no
matter how well thought out.  Phone book designers must be free to  cre-
ate  new attributes in an well-understood fashion to meet changing busi-
ness needs.

Flexibility is required of the attribute definition syntax for  many  of
the  same reasons that semantic extensibility is necessary. If we assume
that phone book designers may need to  define  attributes  of  arbitrary
type, the syntax chosen must be able to represent these objects cleanly.
The meta-language used  to  describe  LDAP  attributes  fits  this  bill
nicely,  since  it  can  be used to unambiguously describe virtually any
data type.

Integration with LDAP-based directories: although it  is  unlikely  that
phone books will be stored in the directory due to performance consider-
ations, the creation of an LDAP schema describing phone book  attributes
leaves  that  option  open,  with  relatively  little incremental effort
required to implement it.

Internet-Draft           LDAP Phone Book Schema            November 1997


5.1.  Phone Book Class

5.1.1.  Description
   The Phone Book class is the basic container for phone  book  entries.
   It always contains a phone book version number (applying to the phone
   book as a whole), a phone book name and one or more pointers (in  the
   form of Distinguished Names) to POP objects.  A Phone Book object may
   also  contain  multiple  pointers  to  Provider  and  Setup   objects
   (described  below).   These  pointers  also  take the form of Distin-
   guished Names.

5.1.2.  Syntax
   ( phoneBookClass 1
         NAME 'phoneBookClass'
         SUP top
         STRUCTURAL
         MUST (
              phoneBookVersion $ phoneBookName $ popPointer
         )
         MAY (
              setupPointer $ providerPointer $ supportPointer
         )
   )

5.2.  Provider Class

5.2.1.  Description
   The Provider class contains  attributes  pertaining  to  the  general
   business  operations  of  a  given  network  service  provider.   The
   attributes include such things as telephone number, mailing  address,
   etc.,  as  well  as  URLs  for  e-mail  and a World Wide Web site.  A
   Provider object may also contain a pointer (in the form of a  Distin-
   guished Name) to support information.

5.2.2.  Syntax
   ( providerClass 1
        NAME 'providerClass'

5.3.  POP Class

5.3.1.  Description
   The  POP  class  contains  attributes  relevant to individual network
   points of presence (POPs).  The required attributes  are  addrFamily,
   address,  media and entryVersion.  The media attribute represents the
   media types supported by the POP, while the entryVersion attribute is
   a  monotonically-increasing integer which should be incremented when-
   ever the object is modified.

5.3.2.  Syntax
   ( popClass 1
        NAME 'popClass'
        SUP top
        PARENT (

             $ popSetupPointer $ popSupportPointer $ popProviderPointer
        )
   )

5.4.  Support Class

5.4.1.  Description
   The Support class includes those attributes that are pertinent to the
   provision of customer support for a POP or provider.

5.4.2.  Syntax
   ( supportClass 1
        NAME 'supportClass'
        SUP top

5.5.  Setup Class

5.5.1.  Description
   The Setup class includes attributes which describe services which may
   change from provider to provider or even from POP to  POP.   Many  of
   the  values  contained  in these attributes may be available by other
   means (e.g., DHCP), but others may not.

6.1.1.1.  Description
   The phoneBookVersion attribute is an integer representing the version
   of  the  phone  book;  it is a monotonically increasing counter which
   should be incremented each time the phone  book  is  modified.   This
   attribute  can  be  used  by  a  server  to help decide what (if any)
   actions are required to bring a client's phone book up to date.   For

   example,  the  client can, at connect time, send an update request to
   the server including in the request the version number of its current
   phone  book.   If  the client's phone book version is not the same as
   the server's current phone book version, the server can  easily  take
   appropriate  action,  e.g.,  reply with a URL pointing to a file con-
   taining the differences between the client and server phone books.

   The modemProtocols attribute is a bit string representing  the  modem
   protocols  supported  by  the  access  devices that can be reached at
   address.  The initially defined modem protocol flags  are  listed  in
   the  table  below.   All  'Position'  values  are in hexadecimal, all
   'Speed' values are in bits per second.  If the bit in  'Position'  is
   1,  'Protocol'  is  supported;  otherwise, 'Protocol' is unsupported.
   For example, the string 00110001 (0x31) means that V.21, V.32bis  and
   V.34 are supported while V.22, V.29 and V.32 are not.

6.3.7.1.  Description
   The isdnProtocols attribute is a bit  string  representing  the  ISDN
   protocols  supported  by  the  access  devices that can be reached at
   address.  The initially defined ISDN  protocols  are  listed  in  the
   table below.  All 'Value. values are in hexadecimal, all 'Speed' val-
   ues are in bits per second.  If the bit in 'Position' is  1,  'Proto-
   col'  is  supported; otherwise, 'Protocol' is unsupported.  For exam-
   ple, the string 00001101 (0x0d) means that V.120 is supported at both
   56K and 64K bps while V.110 is supported only at 19.2K bps.

   same base username.

   base username.
