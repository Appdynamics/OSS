1.  Introduction

   The attribute 'mail' [RFC4524] can be used to store Internet mail
   addresses with internationalized <domain> by using the the A-label
   form [RFC5890] to produce <sub-domain> components of the <Mailbox>
   production.  But it cannot be used to store addresses with <local-
   part> containing non-ASCII characters.

   Therefore this document defines a new attribute type 'intlMailAddr'
   for fully internationalized Internet mail addresses as defined in
   [RFC6530].

   Often the need arises to associate an Internet mail address (which
   most times is not personal) with an arbitrary object (a service or
   system user) so applications can look up where to send mail for this
   object.  Many times the commonly available object class
   'inetOrgPerson' [RFC2798] is wrongly used for storing such non-
   personal Internet mail addresses in attribute 'mail' [RFC4524].

   Therefore this document defines the auxiliary object class
   'mailboxRelatedObject' that can be used to associate an arbitrary
   object with an Internet mail address.  It allows adding an Internet
   mail address attribute to any entry and allows to use either one or
   both of attributes 'mail' and 'intlMailAddr'.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document is being discussed on the ldapext@ietf.org mailing
   list.

2.  Attribute Type Definition

   The attribute type 'intlMailAddr' is defined for storing SMTPUTF8
   compliant addresses [RFC6530].

       ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.5427.1.389.4.18
         NAME 'intlMailAddr'
         DESC 'Internationalized Email Address'
         EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
         SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax and the
   'caseIgnoreMatch' and 'caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch' rules are described
   in [RFC4517].

   Note that an application might have used the A-label form [RFC5890]
   to produce <sub-domain> components of the <Mailbox> production.  This
   leads to different possible string representations of the same
   internationalized Internet mail address which could be listed as
   different values entry's 'intlMailAddr' attribute, operational issues
   may arise.

   The following issues like described for attribute type 'mail' in
   [RFC4524] have to be considered also for 'intlMailAddr' defined
   above:

   Note that the directory will not ensure that values of this attribute
   conform to the <Mailbox> production [RFC5321].  It is the
   application's responsibility to ensure that domains it stores in this
   attribute are appropriately represented.

   Additionally, the directory will compare values per the matching
   rules named in the above attribute type description.  As these rules
   differ from rules that normally apply to <Mailbox> comparisons,
   operational issues may arise.  For example, the assertion
   (mail=joe@example.com) will match "JOE@example.com" even though the
   <local-parts> differ.  Also, where a user has two <Mailbox>es whose
   addresses differ only by case of the <local-part>, both cannot be
   listed as values of the entry's 'intlMailAddr' attribute in the same
   entry (as they are considered equal by the 'caseIgnoreMatch' rule).

3.  Object Class Definition

   Entries of auxiliary object class 'mailboxRelatedObject' MAY contain
   the following optional attributes: 'mail' [RFC4524] 'displayName'
   [RFC2798] 'intlMailAddr'

Internet-Draft        LDAP Mailbox Related Objects        September 2014


       ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.5427.1.389.6.9
         NAME 'mailboxRelatedObject'
         DESC 'Associated RFC 5321 mailbox for any entry'
         AUXILIARY
         MAY ( displayName $ mail $ intlMailAddr ) )

   'mail' and 'intlMailAddr' are listed as optional attributes to allow
   to use only one of both.

   If 'mail' and 'intlMailAddr' are both set an application MAY choose
   one or the other to send mail to the entity represented by the
   directory entry.  Therefore Internet mail addresses in attributes
   'mail' and 'intlMailAddr' SHOULD represent the same mailbox if both
   are set or at least the entity MUST be able to retrieve the mail sent
   to either one of the addresses.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The OID arc used for the attribute type and object class definition
   is:
   iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4) enter-prise(1)
   stroeder.com(5427) public(1) ldap(389)

5.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of these object classes does not impact the security
   of the Internet or a particular LDAP directory service.

   Security considerations for LDAP in general are discussed in
   documents comprising the technical specification [RFC4510].
