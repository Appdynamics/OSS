2. Abstract 
    
   There are times when an LDAP [1] search would return a DN-valued 
   attribute with multiple values.  As the number of values in a multi-
   value attribute increases, it becomes apparent that being able to 
   query the multi-valued attribute is increasingly valuable.  This 
   document describes an LDAP extended search control that returns DN-
   valued attributes as objects and their attributes in the 
   searchResultEntry and also allows filters to be applied to the 
   values in a large multi-valued attribute.  Using this control to 
   search multi-valued attributes reduces the number of client queries 
   required to search multi-valued attributes.

3. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2]. 
    
    
4. ASQ Control for searching DN-valued multi-value attributes 
    
   The Attribute Scoped Query control is a new control specified as per 
   section 4.1.12 of RFC 2251[1].  The ASQ control allows a sorted 
   search of large DN-valued multi-value attributes.  By returning the 
   DN-valued attributes as objects and also allowing for filters to be 
   applied, the control lowers clients parsing overhead and the network 
   traffic depending on the filter applied. 
    
    
4.1 Attribute Query Control 
    
   The ASQ control MUST only be used with a SearchRequest message.  
   (This section of the document references attributes defined in 
   section 4.5.1 of RFC2251 [1] for a SearchRequest.)  A server MUST 
   ignore the control if used with any other message unless the 
   criticality field is set to True, in which case the entire operation 
   MUST fail and MUST instead return the resultCode 
   unsupportedCriticalExtension as per section 4.1.12 of RFC 2251[1].  
   The server MUST list that it recognizes this control in the 
   supportedControl attribute in the root DSE(section 4.1.12 of RFC 
   2251 [1]). 
    
   The attributeQuery control is included in the searchRequest and 
   searchResult messages as part of the server controls field of the 
   LDAPMessage. The structure of this control is as follows: 
    
   attributeQueryControl ::= SEQUENCE { 
                controlType     1.2.840.113556.1.4.1504  
                controlValue    attributeQueryControlValue 
                criticality     TRUE 
        } 
    
    
   The attributeQueryRequestControlValue in the SearchRequest is an 
   OCTET STRING wrapping the BER-encoded version of the following: 
   attributeQueryRequestControlValue ::= SEQUENCE { 
                sourceAttribute         string   
        } 
    
   sourceAttribute: Specifies which DN-valued attribute of the object 
   in the searchRequest the attribute query should be performed 
   against.  Only ONE sourceAttribute may be specified.

              searching DN-valued multi-value attributes 
    
4.2 Attribute Query Response Control 
    
   The attributeQueryResponseControlValue in the SearchResponse is an 
   OCTET STRING wrapping the BER-encoded version of the following: 
   attributeQueryResponseControlValue ::= SEQUENCE { 
                result  ENUMERATED { 
                success                 (0), 
                invalidAttributeSyntax  (21), 
                unwillingToPerform      (53), 
                affectsMultipleDSAs     (71), 
                } 
        } 
    
    
   Result: 
   Success is returned when the query can be successfully completed and 
   information can be returned for all referenced objects.  
   InvalidAttributeSyntax: returned when the values of the attribute 
   specified in sourceAttribute are not of a DN-Value and cannot be 
   resolved. 
   UnwillingToPerform: returned when scope is NOT baseObject(0). 
   affectsMultipleDSAs: This is a special error code stating that 
   entries were returned, but that not all information was available on 
   the local server.  The client MAY wish to chase down individual 
   objects not on the server to resolve the missing information. 
    
    
    
4.3 Attribute Scoped Query Semantics 
    
   The Search Result will consist of each value of the multi-value DN-
   valued attribute returned as a SearchResultEntry, with all 
   attributes specified in the AttributeDescriptionList.   
    
   The server will use all other SearchRequest options to determine the 
   values returned in the result set.  Note that use of this control is 
   limited to a baseObject (0) scoped search. 
    
   The server MAY resolve information for objects that are not stored 
   on the local DSA.  In this case the server can utilize chaining to 
   return all information that the user has permissions to view.  The 
   use of chaining MUST NOT violate permissions in the DIT. 
    
   If the server decides not to perform chaining, it SHOULD return the 
   referrals for attributes not available on the DSA.  The server MUST 
   return the error code affectsMultipleDSAs(71) to inform the client 
   that some information that might otherwise be available is not 
   present.

5. Example: 
    
    
   Assume the following object and attribute values: 
   dn:cn=foo,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        members:cn=homer,dc=bar,dc=com; 
                cn=marge,dc=bar,dc=com; 
                cn=bart,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;group; 
        cn:Foo; 
        bogusAtt:Value; 
   dn:cn=homer,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;user; 
        telephoneNumber:123-4567; 
                        456-7890; 
        office:15/1515; 
        shoesize:12; 
   dn:cn=marge,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;group; 
        members:cn=lisa,dc=bar,dc=com 
                cn=maggie,dc=bar,dc=com 
   dn:cn=bart,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;printer; 
        office:20/2020; 
   dn=cn=barnie,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectclass:Top;user; 
        office:12/1212; 
    
   If a sorted base object searchRequest with attribute description 
   list  objectClass;telephoneNumber;office' was performed on 
   "cn=foo,dc=bar,dc=com" with control Attribute Scoped Query with 
   values: 
   sourceAttribute:members 
   the server would return a searchResult with control Attribute Scoped 
   Query and controlValue result success with the following 
   SearchResultEntry messages: 
   dn:cn=homer,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;user; 
        telephoneNumber:123-4567; 
                        456-7890; 
        office:15/1515; 
   dn:cn=marge,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;group; 
   dn:cn=bart,dc=bar,dc=com; 
        objectClass:Top;printer; 
        office:20/2020;
