1.  Introduction

   This document registers the SASL mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-
   SHA-256-PLUS.

   The registration form for the SCRAM family of algorithms is also
   updated.

   Note: this paragraph may be removed before publication.
   This document was written because [RFC5802] requires that new SASL
   mechanisms in the SCRAM family be subject to IETF review.  This
   document is being discussed in the KITTEN working group (see the
   kitten@ietf.org [1] mailing list).  It was pursued further because of
   a desire for its use within a document being discussed in the HTTP-
   AUTH working group (see the httpauth@ietf.org [2] mailing list).

2.  SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS

   The SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS SASL mechanism are defined
   in the same way that SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS are defined in
   [RFC5802], except that the hash function for HMAC() and H() uses
   SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 [RFC6234].

   For the SCRAM-SHA-256/SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS SASL mechanisms, servers
   SHOULD announce a hash iteration-count of at least 4096.

   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SCRAM-SHA-256 is TBD1 (see Section 4).

   This is a simple example of a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication exchange
   when the client doesn't support channel bindings (username 'user' and
   password 'pencil' are used):

   C: n,,n=user,r=rOprNGfwEbeRWgbNEkqO

   S: r=rOprNGfwEbeRWgbNEkqO%hvYDpWUa2RaTCAfuxFIlj)hNlF$k0,

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC5802] still apply.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA registry for the SCRAM family of SASL mechanisms is updated
   as follows.  This revised form adds two new fields: Minimum
   iteration-count and Associated OID.  In addition, the email address
   for reviews has been updated.

      To: iana@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of a new SASL family SCRAM

      SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family): SCRAM-*
      Security considerations: Section 7 of [RFC5802]
      Published specification (optional, recommended): RFCXXXX
      Minimum iteration-count: The minimum iteration-count that servers
      SHOULD announce
      Associated OID: IANA SHOULD assign a GSS-API mechanism OID for
      this mechanism from the iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms
      prefix (see the "SMI Security for Mechanism Codes" registry).
      Only one OID needs to be assigned for a SCRAM-* and SCRAM-*-PLUS
      pair.  The same OID should be assigned to both entries in the
      registry.
      Person & email address to contact for further information: IETF
      KITTEN WG kitten@ietf.org
      Intended usage: COMMON
      Owner/Change controller: IESG iesg@ietf.org
      Note: Members of this family MUST be explicitly registered using
      the "IETF Review" [RFC5226] registration procedure.  Reviews MUST
      be requested on the KITTEN mailing list kitten@ietf.org (or a
      successor designated by the responsible Security AD).

      Note to future SCRAM-mechanism designers: each new SCRAM-SASL
      mechanism MUST be explicitly registered with IANA and MUST comply
      with SCRAM-mechanism naming convention defined in Section 4 of
      [RFC5802].

   The following values are to be added to the existing registries for
   SASL SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS:

      Minimum iteration-count: 4096
      OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.14 (from [RFC5802])

   The following new SASL SCRAM mechanisms are added:

      IANA has added the following entries to the SASL Mechanism
      registry established by [RFC4422]:

      To: iana@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of a new SASL mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256

      SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family): SCRAM-SHA-256
      Security considerations: Section Section 3 of RFCXXXX
      Published specification (optional, recommended): RFCXXXX
      Minimum iteration-count: 4096
      OID: TBD1
      Person & email address to contact for further information: IETF
      KITTEN WG kitten@ietf.org
      Intended usage: COMMON
      Owner/Change controller: IESG iesg@ietf.org
      Note:

      To: iana@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of a new SASL mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS

      SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family): SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
      Security considerations: Section Section 3 of RFCXXXX
      Published specification (optional, recommended): RFCXXXX
      Minimum iteration-count: 4096
      OID: TBD1
      Person & email address to contact for further information: IETF
      KITTEN WG kitten@ietf.org
      Intended usage: COMMON
      Owner/Change controller: IESG iesg@ietf.org
      Note:

   [This note may be removed on publication.]  IANA needs to assign the
   GSS-API mechanism OID TBD1 listed above from the
   iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms prefix (see the "SMI
   Security for Mechanism Codes" registry).
