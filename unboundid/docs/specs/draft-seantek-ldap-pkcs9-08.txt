Internet-Draft         LDAP PKCS #9 Registrations      November 14, 2017


1.  Introduction

   This document registers the LDAP [LDAPMAP] schema definitions
   [LDAPDIM] for a subset of elements specified in PKCS #9 [PKCS#9],
   including attribute types; matching rules and syntaxes to be used
   with these attribute types; and related object classes.

   The Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) series is a group of
   documents originally published by RSA Security, Inc. in the early
   1990s. These de-facto industry standards specify cryptographic
   formats and associated operations, such as the mathematical
   properties of the RSA algorithm and of cryptographic software and
   hardware modules. Since initial publication, change control of many
   PKCS documents was transferred to the IETF.

   [PKCS#9] "Selected Object Classes and Attribute Types" "provides a
   selection of object classes and attribute types for use in
   conjunction with public-key cryptography and Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) accessible directories." Many of these ASN.1
   data items are used throughout cryptographic implementations, but
   standardized names were never put into the IANA LDAP Parameters
   registry. LDAP parameters are frequently user-visible (for better or
   for worse) so registering these parameters will improve both
   interoperability and usability.

   As the elements and their semantics are defined in [PKCS#9], this
   document needs to be read in conjunction with [PKCS#9] to make use of
   the LDAP registrations provided herein. [PKCS#9] provides complete
   definitions, with one significant omission: the IANA Considerations
   section was never appended. This document provides the IANA
   Considerations section necessary to register appropriate descriptors.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP14].

2.  Syntaxes

   Appendix B.1 of [PKCS#9] describes various syntaxes used in LDAP to
   transfer PKCS #9 elements and related data types.

3.  Matching Rules

   Appendix B.4 of [PKCS#9] provides matching rules for use in LDAP.

4.  Attribute Types

   Appendix B.3 of [PKCS#9] details attribute types for use in LDAP,

   including (by its own admission) attributes that are "highly
   unlikely" to be stored in a Directory. This document registers all
   such attributes en masse.

   [PKCS#9] includes certain attribute types that have found meaningful
   use outside of the PKCS series. Specifically:

      o  emailAddress is mandated in [SMIMEv3.2C], and has mandatory
         processing requirements if included in a certificate
         [PKIXPROF].
      o  [PKIXPROF] recommends the recognition of pseudonym.
      o  The Qualified Certificates Profile [QCPROF] requires both
         pseudonym and the vital records dateOfBirth, placeOfBirth,
         gender, countryOfCitizenship, and countryOfResidence.
      o  "DESC" is sometimes emitted for the description (2.5.4.13)
         attribute.

   As a result, certain applications not only encounter and generate
   these attributes in practice, but also use short descriptors that
   have come to be widely recognized.

   Implementations SHOULD also note that "gn" is a common descriptor for
   "givenName" (2.5.4.42), and is widely emitted by cryptographic
   applications.

4.1.  Semantics of dateOfBirth Clarified

   [PKCS#9] Section 5.2.4 states that dateOfBirth "is the date of birth
   for the subject it is associated with." Its GeneralizedTime syntax,
   however, requires time and time zone specifications that are not
   related to dateOfBirth's semantics.

   [QCPROF] RECOMMENDS that the time recorded be GMT (i.e., UTC) noon
   down to the granularity of seconds "in order to prevent accidental
   change of date due to time zone adjustments." Since contemporary time
   zones range from -1200 to +1400, however, naive processing will
   misinterpret this value by one day for timezones significantly ahead
   of UTC.

   The semantics of dateOfBirth are hereby defined: in dateOfBirth, only
   the date is meaningful. Parsers that need to convert the
   GeneralizedTime value to a specific point in time MUST decode the
   date in the UTC timezone to avoid shifting of the date due to
   timezone differences (such as in +14). Thus, a subject born in
   GMT+1400 will have a GeneralizedTime value that is essentially one
   day ahead (2am), when interpreted literally.

   When stored in LDAP, a conformant implementation MAY record this
 


Leonard                      Informational                      [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         LDAP PKCS #9 Registrations      November 14, 2017


   value in UTC or in local time, but MUST NOT record this value with a
   timezone offset. I.e., [X.680] subclauses 46.2 a) and b) and 46.3 a)
   and b) are acceptable; subclauses 46.2 c) and 46.3 c) are not
   acceptable. When comparing such values, "local time" values SHALL be
   compared as if the local time is UTC.

   The following sentence of [QCPROF] Section 3.2.2 remains in effect
   for both certificate and non-certificate uses: "Compliant
   [certificate] [sic] parsing applications SHOULD ignore any time data
   and just present the contained date without any time zone
   adjustments."

4.2.  Short Descriptors for Certain Useful Attribute Types

   As permitted by Section 3.4 of [LDAPIANA], the short descriptors in
   Table 1 are registered along with their more verbose counterparts
   reflected in [PKCS#9]:

               Short Descriptor     Regular Descriptor
               ---------------------------------------
               e                    emailAddress
               dob                  dateOfBirth
               pob                  placeOfBirth
               g                    gender
               coc                  countryOfCitizenship
               cor                  countryOfResidence
               pnym                 pseudonym

         Table 1: Short Descriptors for Certain Attribute Types

4.3.  Short Descriptors for Certain Other Attribute Types

   As permitted by Section 3.4 of [LDAPIANA], the short descriptors in
   Table 2 are registered along with their more verbose counterparts
   elsewhere:

               Short Descriptor     Regular Descriptor
               ---------------------------------------
               desc                 description

         Table 2: Short Descriptors for Certain Attribute Types

5.  Object Classes

   Appendix B.2 of [PKCS#9] details a set of object classes for use in
   LDAP.

6.  Security Considerations

   PKCS #9 security considerations (written for the RFC edition)
   [PKCS#9] apply to the definitions in this document. LDAP security and
   privacy considerations in [LDAPMAP] and [LDAPDIM] apply as well.

   Some attributes such as those in [QCPROF], namely dateOfBirth,
   placeOfBirth, gender, countryOfCitizenship, and countryOfResidence
   are sensitive and may be subject to privacy laws in certain
   jurisdictions. If conveyed with LDAP, these attributes ought to be
   returned over a protected channel, such as TLS.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall register an LDAP Object Identifier [LDAPIANA] for use
   in this technical specification. The IANA shall update the LDAP
   Descriptor registry [LDAPIANA] with definitions from [PKCS#9] as
   indicated below.
