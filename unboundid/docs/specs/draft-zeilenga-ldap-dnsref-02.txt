Abstract

  This document describes how LDAP service location information stored
  on DNS SRV resource records may be used to in conjunction with named
  subordinate referral objects.  This document defines the dNSReferral
  object class.

Conventions

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 description formats
  [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


1.  Background and Intended Use

  Named subordinate referral [NAMEDREF] defines a specific method for
  representing subordinate references in LDAP [RFC2251] directories.
  This document describes a mechanism for using LDAP service location
  information [LOCATE] available in DNS SRV resource records [RFC2782]
  to rewrite select LDAP URLs [RFC2255] returned to clients as referrals
  and search continuations.


2.  Schema

  A dNSReferral object is a directory entry whose structural object
  class is the dNSreferral object class.

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.4.8 NAME 'dNSReferral'
          DESC 'DNS SRV aware named subordinate referral object'
          SUP referral STRUCTURAL )

  dNSReferral objects SHOULD have distinguished names comprising of RDNs
  consisting of only dc (domainComponent) attributes (e.g.,
  dc=example,dc=net) as detailed in [RFC2247].

  dNSReferral objects SHALL behave like referral objects [NAMEDREF]
  except as detailed in the following section.


3.  Construction of Referrals and Search References

  In the referral processing described by [NAMEDREF], if a LDAP URL with
  no hostpart is to be returned to the client as part of a referral or
  search continuation, it is replaced with one or more LDAP URLs based
  upon service location information.

  The server SHOULD obtain service location information [LOCATE] for the
  DN [RFC2253] present in (or implied by) the LDAP URL [RFC2255].  If no
  service location information is available, the server MUST return the

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-zeilenga-ldap-dnsref-02     20 November 2001


  LDAP URL as described in [NAMEDREF].

  Otherwise, the server SHALL replace the LDAP URL with a set of
  constructed LDAP URLs.  For each service host port pair provided, the
  server constructs an LDAP URL by replacing the empty hostport with
  concatenation of the service host, ":", and the port.


4.   Example

  Suppose a directory server contains:

       dn: dc=sub,dc=example,dc=net
       dc: sub
       objectClass: dNSReferral
       objectClass: extensibleObject
       ref: ldap:///dc=sub,dc=example,dc=net

  and DNS holds the following SRV records:

       _ldap._tcp.sub.example.net. IN SRV 0 0 389 l1.sub.example.net.
       _ldap._tcp.sub.example.net. IN SRV 0 0 389 l2.sub.example.net.

  and a client requests a compareRequest with a target DN of
  "dc=sub,dc=example,dc=net".  In response to this request, the server
  would return:

       compareResponse "referral" {
            ldap://l1.sub.example.net:389/dc=sub,dc=example,dc=net
            ldap://l2.sub.example.net:389/dc=sub,dc=example,dc=net
       }


5.  Security Considerations

  This mechanism extends [NAMEDREF] based upon [LOCATE].  The security
  considerations discussed in these documents generally apply to the
  specification described in this document.

  In addition, this mechanism requires the server to make DNS queries.
  DNS responses are subject to spoofing.  Use of DNSSEC is RECOMMENDED
  where appropriate.  Also, DNS queries may require significant time and
  resources.
