             Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP):
                      Schema for Printer Services
              <draft-mcdonald-ldap-printer-schema-13.txt>


Abstract 

   This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
   Printers and Print Services, for use with directories that support
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is
   based on the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet
   Printing Protocol/1.1 (RFC 2911).  Additional Printer attributes are
   based on definitions in the Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805), IEEE-ISTO PWG 
   Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2), IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP
   Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (PWG 5100.13), and IEEE-ISTO PWG
   IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14).  
   
   This memo is an independent submission to the RFC Editor Stream by
   the Internet Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer
   Working Group, as part of their PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14)
   project for secure mobile printing with vendor-neutral Client
   software.  
   
   This document obsoletes RFC 3712.

Internet-Draft      LDAP Schema for Printer Services       30 April 2015



1.  Introduction

   This document defines several object classes to provide Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510] applications with flexible
   options in defining Printer information using LDAP schema.  Classes
   are provided for defining directory entries with common Printer
   information as well as for extending existing directory entries with
   SLPv2 [RFC2608], IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179]
   protocol-specific information.  
   
   This memo is an independent submission to the RFC Editor Stream by
   the Internet Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer
   Working Group, as part of their PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14)
   project for secure mobile printing with vendor-neutral Client
   software.  
   
   Please send comments directly to the authors at the addresses listed
   in the section "Authors' Addresses".  
   
   
   
   1.1.  Relationship to SLP Printer Service
   
   The schema defined in this document is technically aligned with the
   stable IANA-registered 'service:printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20],
   for compatibility with already deployed Service Location Protocol
   (SLPv2) [RFC2608] service advertising and discovery infrastructure.
   The attribute syntaxes are technically aligned with the
   'service:printer:' v2.0 template - therefore simpler types are
   sometimes used (for example, 'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] rather than
   'labeledURI' [RFC2079] for the 'printer-uri' attribute).  
   
   
   
   1.2.  Source of LDAP Printer Attributes
   
   The schema defined in this document is based on:  all of the Printer 
   attributes listed in Appendix E 'Generic Directory Schema' that are
   defined in section 4.4 'Printer Description Attributes' of Internet
   Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [RFC2911]; and selected
   Printer attributes defined in the Printer MIB v2 [RFC3805], IEEE-ISTO
   PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID [PWG5107.2], IEEE-ISTO PWG
   IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 [PWG5100.13], and IEEE-ISTO
   PWG IPP Everywhere [PWG5100.14] 
   
   See the table of Printer attributes and source documents in section 4
   'Definition of Attribute Types' in this document.

   1.3.  Source of LDAP Printer Schema OIDs
   
   
   
   1.3.1.  IBM Assignments for RFC 3712
   
   In March 2000, IBM permanently assigned ASN.1 OIDs to all of the
   object classes and attributes types that were defined in the original
   LDAP Printer Schema [RFC3712] (see section 7.2).  
   
   
   
   1.3.2.  IEEE-ISTO PWG Assignments
   
   In October 2011, IBM permanently delegated the base ASN.1 OID
   "1.3.18.0.2.24.46" to the IEEE-ISTO PWG for use in any PWG project.  
   In October 2011, the IEEE-ISTO PWG permanently assigned subordinate
   ASN.1 OIDs for all of the new attribute types defined in this updated
   LDAP Printer Schema (see section 7.1).  
   
   
   
   1.4.  Rationale for Design Choices
   
   
   
   1.4.1.  Rationale for using DirectoryString Syntax
   
   The attribute syntax 'DirectoryString' (UTF-8 [STD63]) defined in
   [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       - printer-uri, printer-xri-supported, printer-more-info,
       printer-charge-info-uri, printer-uuid 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with deployment of (UTF-8 based)
       IRI Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987].  
       
   2)  Description 
       - printer-name, printer-location, printer-info,
       printer-make-and-model 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding supports descriptions in any language,
       conformant with the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages
       [BCP18].  
       
       Note:  The printer-natural-language-configured attribute contains
       a language tag [BCP47] for these description attributes (for

       example, to support text-to-speech conversions).  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       - printer-compression-supported, printer-finishings-supported,
       printer-media-supported, printer-media-local-supported,
       printer-print-quality-supported 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with the current IPP/1.1
       [RFC2911] definition of the equivalent attributes, most of which
       have the IPP/1.1 union syntax 'keyword or name'.  The keyword
       attributes defined in this document are extensible by
       site-specific or vendor-specific 'names' which behave like new
       'keywords' 
       
       Note:  In IPP/1.1, each value is strongly typed over-the-wire as 
       either 'keyword' or 'name'.  This union selector is not preserved
       in the definitions of these equivalent LDAP attributes.  
   
   
   
   1.4.2.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreMatch
   
   The EQUALITY matching rule 'caseIgnoreMatch' defined in [RFC4517] is 
   specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in
   this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       
       These URI attributes specify EQUALITY matching with
       'caseIgnoreMatch' (rather than with 'caseExactMatch') in order to
       conform to the spirit of [STD66], which requires case insensitive
       matching on the host part of a URI versus case sensitive matching
       on the remainder of a URI.  
       
       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case 
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].  
       
       Either equality matching rule choice would be a compromise:  
       a) case sensitive whole URI matching can lead to false negative
       matches and has been shown to be fragile (given deployed client
       applications that 'pretty up' host names displayed and
       transferred in URI); 
       b) case insensitive whole URI matching can lead to false positive
       matches, although it is a dangerous practice to publish URI that
       differ only by case (for example, in the path elements).  
       
   2)  Description 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       description attributes.

   3)  Keyword 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       keyword attributes.  
       
   4)  IEEE 1284 Device ID 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is mandatory for IEEE 1284
       Device ID attributes.  
   
   
   
   1.4.3.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
   
   The SUBSTR matching rule 'caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch' defined in
   [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       
       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case 
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].  
       
   2)  Description 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for description attributes.  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for keyword attributes.  
       
   4)  IEEE 1284 Device ID 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is mandatory for
       IEEE 1284 Device ID attributes.

3.  Definition of Object Classes

   We define the following LDAP object classes for use with both generic
   Printer related information and services specific to SLPv2 [RFC2608],
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179].  
   
   slpServicePrinter - auxiliary class for SLP registered Printers
   printerAbstract - abstract class for all Printer classes
   printerService - structural class for Printers
   printerServiceAuxClass - auxiliary class for Printers
   printerIPP - auxiliary class for IPP Printers
   printerLPR - auxiliary class for LPR Printers
   
   The following are some examples of how applications could choose to
   use these classes when creating directory entries:  
   
   1)  Use printerService for directory entries containing common
       Printer information.  
       
   2)  Use both printerService and slpServicePrinter for directory
       entries containing common Printer information for SLP registered
       Printers.  
       
   3)  Use printerService, printerLPR and printerIPP for directory
       entries containing common Printer information for Printers that
       support both LPR and IPP.  
       
   4)  Use printerServiceAuxClass and object classes not defined by this
       document for directory entries containing common Printer
       information.  In this example, printerServiceAuxClass is used for
       extending other structural classes defining Printer information
       with common printer information defined in this document.  
   
   Refer to Section 4 for definition of attribute types referenced by
   these object classes.  We use attribute names instead of OIDs in
   object class definitions for clarity.  Some attribute names described
   in [RFC2911] have been prefixed with 'printer-' as recommended in
   [RFC2926] and [SLPPRT20].

4.  Definition of Attribute Types

   The following attribute types are referenced by the object classes
   defined in Section 3.  
   
   The following attribute types reference syntax OIDs defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC4517] (see Section 5 'Definition of Syntaxes'
   below).  
   
   The following attribute types reference matching rule names (instead
   of OIDs) for clarity (see Section 6 below).  For optional attributes,
   if the Printer information is not known, the attribute value SHOULD
   NOT be set.  In the following definitions, referenced matching rules
   are defined in Section 4 of [RFC4517] and discussed in Section 6
   'Definition of Matching Rules' later in this document.  
   
   Note:  For compatibility with existing implementations of [RFC3712]
   and underlying string length limits in [RFC2707], [RFC2911],
   [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], [PWG5100.13], and [PWG5100.14],
   implementations of the attributes defined in this document SHOULD NOT
   exceed those underlying string length limits (to avoid truncation and
   false matches).  
   
   Note:  For interoperability and consistent text display, values of
   attributes defined in this document:  (a) SHOULD be normalized as
   recommended in Unicode Format for Network Interchange [RFC5198]; (b) 
   SHOULD NOT contain DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters except for
   HT, CR, and LF; (c) SHOULD only contain CR and LF characters together
   (not as singletons); and SHOULD NOT contain HT, CR, or LF characters
   in names, e.g., printer-name and printer-aliases.  
   
   Note:  Some of the following attributes are described as 'List of
   xxx' (using a comma as the member delimiter).  Some other attributes
   are described as 'One of xxx' (single-valued).  In all cases, any
   attribute can have multiple values represented as multiple instances,
   except where explictly restricted in syntax to be single-valued.  
   
   Note:  Values of the string attributes printer-xri-supported and
   printer-resolution-supported use different field delimiters ('<' and 
   '>', respectively).  These two field delimiters are different for
   compatibility with the corresponding attributes in the
   IANA-registered SLP 'service:printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20],
   which was defined before the original LDAP Printer Schema [RFC3712]
   was written.  
   
   The following table is a summary of the attribute names defined by
   this document and their corresponding source document names as
   defined in [RFC2911], [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], or [PWG5100.13].  Some
   source attribute names have been prefixed with 'printer-' as

   An XRI (extended resource identifier) supported by this Printer.
   Each value of this attribute MUST consist of a URI (uniform resource 
   identifier) followed by (optional) authentication and security
   fields.  
   
   Each XRI field MUST be delimited by '<', with optional trailing
   whitespace.  For example:  
   
       'uri=ipp://example.com/ipp< auth=digest< sec=tls<'
       'uri=ipps://example.com/ipp< auth=digest< sec=tls<'
       'uri=lpr://example.com/lpr< auth=none< sec=none<'
       'uri=mailto:printer@example.com< auth=none< sec=none<'
   
   Note:  See the note in section 4 about the different field delimiters
   used in the printer-xri-supported and printer-resolution-supported
   attributes ('<' and '>', respectively), chosen for compatibility with
   the IANA-registered SLP 'service:printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20].
   
   Note:  Multiple values for this attribute are represented as multiple

   Note:  For compatibility with IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], values of this
   attribute SHOULD NOT exceed 1023 octets in length.  
   
   Note:  LDAP application clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use malformed
   URI values read from this attribute.  LDAP administrative clients
   SHOULD not write malformed URI values into this attribute.  
   
   Note:  This attribute is based on the IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] attributes
   'printer-uri-supported', 'uri-authentication-supported', and
   'uri-security-supported' (called the 'Three Musketeers' because they
   are parallel, ordered attributes).  This attribute unfolds those
   IPP/1.1 attributes and thus avoids the ordering (and same number of
   values) constraints of the IPP/1.1 separate attributes.

   Defined keywords for fields include:  
   
       'uri' (IPP 'printer-uri-supported')
       'auth' (IPP 'uri-authentication-supported')
       'sec' (IPP 'uri-security-supported')
   
   A missing 'auth' field SHOULD be interpreted to mean 'none'.  Per

       'none' (no authentication for this URI)
       'requesting-user-name' (from operation request)
       'basic' (HTTP/1.1 Basic [RFC2617] and [RFC7235])

       'negotiate' (HTTP/1.1 Negotiate [RFC4559])
   
   The 'certificate' value refers to the IPP Client certificate
   extracted from the TLS session.  
   
   A missing 'sec' field SHOULD be interpreted to mean 'none'.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] and IANA IPP Registry [IANAIPP], defined values of

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   All text string attributes defined in this document of syntax
   'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] have values that are encoded in UTF-8
   [STD63], as required by [RFC4517].  
   
   A language tag [BCP47] for all of the text string attributes defined
   in this document is contained in the
   printer-natural-language-configured attribute.  
   
   Therefore, all object classes defined in this document conform to the
   IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages [BCP18].  
   
   Note:  For interoperability and consistent text display, values of
   attributes defined in this document:  (a) SHOULD be normalized as
   recommended in Unicode Format for Network Interchange [RFC5198]; (b) 
   SHOULD NOT contain DEL or any C0 or C1 control characters except for
   HT, CR, and LF; (c) SHOULD only contain CR and LF characters together
   (not as singletons); and SHOULD NOT contain HT, CR, or LF characters
   in names, e.g., printer-name and printer-aliases.  



9.  Security Considerations

   See [RFC4513] for detailed guidance on authentication methods for
   LDAP and the use of TLS/1.2 [RFC5246] to supply connection
   confidentiality and data integrity for LDAP sessions.  
   
   As with any LDAP schema, it is important to protect specific entries 
   and attributes with the appropriate access control.  It is
   particularly important that only administrators can modify entries
   defined in this LDAP Printer schema.  Otherwise, an LDAP client might
   be fooled into diverting print service requests from the original
   Printer (or spooler) to a malicious intruder's host system, thus
   exposing the information in printed documents.  
   
   Note:  Security vulnerabilities can arise if DEL or any C0 or C1
   control characters are included in names, e.g., printer-name or
   printer-aliases.  
   
   For additional security considerations of deploying Printers in an
   IPP environment, see Section 8 of [RFC2911].

11.  Appendix A - Changes since RFC 3712

   1)  Added many editorial corrections and clarifications 
       - corrected typos, missing words, and ambiguous sentences; 
       - replaced lowercase 'printer' with titlecase 'Printer' for
       readability and consistency with IETF and IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP
       standards usage; 
       - added implementation notes; 
       - updated and added references.  
       
   2)  Deleted length restrictions from formal definitions of
       DirectoryString syntax attributes 
       - replaced with notes recommending length restrictions for
       compatibility with existing implementations of [RFC3712] and
       underlying string length limits in [RFC2707], [RFC2911],
       [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], [PWG5100.13], and [PWG5100.14].  
       
   3)  Added new Printer attributes defined in [PWG5107.2],
       [PWG5100.13], and [PWG5100.14] (see section 7.1) 
       - see the table of Printer attributes and source documents in
       section 4 'Definition of Attribute Types' in this document; 
       - added support for IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Everywhere [PWG5100.14]
       project.  
       
   4)  Added implementation note to section 4 about string encodings 
       - added discussion of 'List of xxx' and 'One of xxx' encodings; 
       - stated that any of these attributes can be represented as
       multiple instances (i.e., to avoid length overflow).  
       
   5)  Improved comma-delimited examples of string attributes 
       - added both single-valued and multi-valued examples.  
       
   6)  Clarified use of printer-xri-supported and
       printer-resolution-supported attributes and field delimiters 
       - added note in section 4 Definition of Attribute Types to
       explain the origin of the different field delimiters; 
       - added examples to show optional *trailing* whitespace after '<'
       delimiters in printer-xri-supported; 
       - added examples to show optional *trailing* whitespace after '>'
       delimiters in printer-resolution-supported.  
       
   7)  Clarified section 8 'Internationalization Considerations' 
       - added note about Network Unicode [RFC5198] and avoiding use of
       C0 and C1 control characters.  
       
   8)  Clarified section 9 'Security Considerations' 
       - added note about security vulnerabilities caused by use of DEL
