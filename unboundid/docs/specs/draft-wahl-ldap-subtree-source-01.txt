Internet-Draft   LDAP Subtree Data Source URI Attribute    December 2006


Abstract

   This document defines an attribute that enables administrative
   clients using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to
   determine the source of directory entries.

Internet-Draft   LDAP Subtree Data Source URI Attribute    December 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an optional attribute for use in LDAP [1] to
   indicate the source of data in a directory server naming context.

   In many organizations, the user data entries which can be obtained
   via LDAP from a directory service are not mastered in that directory
   service, but are made available by translation from another directory
   service format or database format.  This translation function is
   typically provided by virtual directory and meta directory
   implementations.

   Administrative clients which are managing a distributed directory
   service deployment might need to determine whether the directory
   server they are communicating with holds directory data which is
   predominately mastered in an external service.  If that external
   service were to become unavailable, the directory server might itself
   become unavailable, or hold outdated information.

   This document defines an attribute that SHOULD be used when a naming
   context in a directory server's directory information tree is
   constructed from information obtained from an external network
   resource, such as another directory server using a different schema,
   or a database.

   This attribute SHOULD NOT be used to represent directory replication
   topology, as other attributes are defined for this purpose.

   This attribute SHOULD NOT be used to indicate another directory
   server which provides substantially identical directory service as
   this server, as the altServer root DSE attribute has already been
   defined for that purpose [2].

   This attribute SHOULD NOT be used in situations where only a few,
   optional, attributes of each directory entry are obtained by the
   directory server from an external data source (e.g. a status
   attribute).  Determining the sources of these attributes is out of
   scope for this specification.

   The words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY" are used as defined in RFC 2119
   [3].

Internet-Draft   LDAP Subtree Data Source URI Attribute    December 2006


2.  Subtree data source attribute

   The subtreeDataSourceURI attribute is defined to be placed at the
   base of a naming context, or other subtree context, in which the
   entries at or subordinate to the entry containing this attribute are
   being generated based on one or more external data sources.

   The attribute is defined as follows (with lines wrapped for
   readability):

     ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.21008.97.74.2.1 NAME 'subtreeDataSourceURI'
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
      EQUALITY caseExactMatch
      USAGE directoryOperation )

   This attribute can contain one or more values, and each value is a
   URI [4].  Each URI is encoded using the Directory string syntax.  The
   caseExactMatch and Directory String syntax are defined in RFC 4517
   [5].

   Unlike the labeledURI attribute [6], these values do not have a
   label.

   In many implementations, the URI might be of the LDAP or HTTP [7]
   forms.

   This document only specifies how a client can read this attribute.
   Some servers MAY support updating this attribute over protocol,
   subject to access control, however for many servers it is anticipated
   that the values of this attribute would be configured through the
   server's out-of-band management interface, such as in a configuration
   file.  The semantics of comparison of values of this attribute for
   equality is outside of the scope of this document.

3.  Security Considerations

   The subtreeDataSourceURI attribute SHOULD be protected by access
   control, and SHOULD NOT be accessible to clients which are not
   administrative tools authenticated to the directory service.

   It is expected that the administrative tools accessing this directory
   will need to obtain authentication credentials to access the external
   data source through out of band means.  The URIs in values in the
   subtreeDataSourceURI attribute SHOULD NOT contain authentication
   credentials, such as passwords.
