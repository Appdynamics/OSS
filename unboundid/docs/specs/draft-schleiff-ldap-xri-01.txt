   in representing XRI (eXtensible Resource Identifier) values in LDAP
   (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and X.500 directory services.

Internet-Draft             LDAP Schema for XRI            September 2006


1.  Background and Intended Use

   This document specifies particular LDAP schema objects pertinent to
   XRI.  It is intended as an Internet-Draft to be referenced in a
   subsequent request for assignment of OID numbers for each schema
   object, according to processes described in [RFC4520].  Technical
   discussion of this document will take place on the
   <directory@apps.ietf.org> mailing list as specified in section 4 of
   [RFC4520].  Please send editorial comments directly to the author
   <marty.schleiff@boeing.com>.

   The OASIS XRI Technical Committee develops specifications for
   representation of various types of resource identifiers within a
   standard framework called XRI (eXtensible Resource Identifier).  XRIs
   identify resources independent of any specific network location,
   domain, application, or protocol.  The OASIS XRI Technical Committee
   homepage is at the following location:

      http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xri

   Conventions for representing an object's XRI(s) in Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 directory services will
   simplify deployment of XRI-aware directory client applications and
   interoperability among such applications.

   This document defines an Object Class and several Attribute Types for
   conventional representation of XRIs in directory services.

   Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
   [RFC4512].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped)
   for readability.  The characters "IANA-ASSIGNED-OID" will appear in
   the LDAP definitions until an OID (Object IDentifier) is obtained via
   procedures described in [RFC4520], under which OIDs will be assigned
   for each schema object.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

2.  Definition of the xRIObject Object Class

   The xRIObject is an auxiliary object class that MAY be added to any
   directory entry for purposes of associating eXtensible Resource
   Identifiers with that object.

     ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1
        NAME 'xRIObject'
        SUP top
        AUXILIARY
        DESC 'objectClass for XRI attribute types'
        MAY ( xRI $ altXRI ) )

3.  Definition of the xRI Attribute Type

   The xRI attribute type MAY be present on a directory entry with
   objectClass = xRIObject.  Although a directory entry may be
   associated with many XRIs, the xRI Attribute Type contains just a
   single value representing the preferred or primary XRI value for that
   entry.  When displaying an entry, especially within a one-line
   summary list, it is useful to be able to identify which of
   potentially several XRIs should be displayed.  If present, the value
   in xRI is the value that should be displayed.  When a search is done
   to find the XRI for a subject, this is the single value that should
   be returned.

     ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2
        NAME ( 'xRI' 'extensibleResourceIdentifier' )
        DESC 'The preferred or primary XRI for the subject.'
        EQUALITY caseExactMatch
        SUBSTR caseExactSubstringMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
        SINGLE-VALUE )

4.  Definition of the altXRI Attribute Type

   The altXRI attribute type MAY be present on a directory entry with
   objectClass = xRIObject.  A directory entry may be associated with
   many XRIs.  To facilitate successful directory searches, the multiple
   XRIs identifying a subject SHOULD be included in the altXRI Attribute
   Type of that subject's directory entry.

     ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.3
        NAME ( 'altXRI' 'alternateExtensibleResourceIdentifer' )
        DESC 'A list of XRIs that are synonymns for the same subject.'
        EQUALITY caseExactMatch
        SUBSTR caseExactSubstringMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

5.  Matching Rule Considerations

   Many kinds of identifiers can be expressed within the XRI framework,
   such as UUIDs, distinguishedName, OID, case insensitive string, case
   sensitive string, numeric, and others.  Because these identifiers
   have differing matching rules, XRI values being stored into directory
   attributes, and those being compared against values in a directory,
   SHOULD be normalized by the LDAP client to a point that
   caseExactMatch will yield desired results.  The xRI and altXRI
   attribute types are defined with caseExactMatch equality matching.
   In contexts where identifiers are known to be XRIs, the "xri:" scheme
   name and following slashes is sometimes omitted; however, successful
   matching will be more achievable with consistent treatment of the
   "xri:" scheme name and following slashes as follows:

   o  When an XRI appears within an XRI cross reference (i.e., within
      parentheses) the "xri://" SHOULD be ommitted.

   o  Otherwise the "xri://" SHOULD be explicitly included.

6.  Security Considerations

   Introduction of these schema objects is not believed to introduce new
   security considerations beyond those described in the OASIS XRI suite
   of specifications.
