2. Abstract 
    
   This document defines a controlError result code to be used in 
   LDAPv3 [1] control extension specifications.  The purpose of this 
   result code is to let the client know that the operation which 
   returned this result code was not successful due to an attached 
   control and that further information is available in one or more 
   controls attached to the response. 
    
    
3. Conventions used in this document 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

                    Result Code for LDAP Controls          March 2002 
    
4. Background and Intended Usage 
    
   LDAPv3 allows for the extension of the protocol through the use of 
   controls.  These controls allow existing operations to be enhanced 
   to provide additional functionality for directory operations.  
   Complex controls are being established that are bringing up error 
   conditions not anticipated in the LDAPv3 specifications. 
    
   This document provides a result code, controlError, which is used to 
   signify a control specific error.  The purpose of this result code 
   is to let the client know that the operation which returned this 
   result code was not successful due to an attached control and that 
   further information is available in one or more controls attached to 
   the response. 
    
   The controlError result code SHOULD be used in a response message to 
   signal that a control specific error condition occurred and 
   additional information is available in the attached control response 
   message.  An example of a control specification using this result 
   code can be seen in the VLV control specification. [3] 
 
    
5. The LDAP controlError Result Code 
    
   The LDAPResult construct as defined in section 4.1.10 of RFC 2251 
   [1] includes a list of valid result codes.  The LDAPResult construct 
   is repeated here for readability: 
    
    
   LDAPResult ::= SEQUENCE { 
                resultCode    ENUMERATED { 
                             success                      (0),

   This document adds another valid result code, controlError(76).   
    
   The controlError MUST be defined in any control specification that 
   makes use of the result code.  A control specification SHALL define 
   under what conditions the controlError result is to be returned and 
   which control will be attached to the response message.  In 
   addition, the control specification SHALL define the control 
   specific errors returned in the attached control. 
    
   A control specification SHOULD NOT use controlError to represent any 
   condition that can be defined using any existing result code in RFC 
   2251. 
    
   The controlError result code MUST be defined in control 
   specifications to signify that the client should parse an embedded 
   result code for additional control specific results.   
    
   In cases where a client receives an LDAP response with the result 
   code of controlError and no attached controls, the response is to be 
   treated as an unknown error condition.

6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document defines an extension to RFC 2251 [1] and has the same 
   security issues.  See the security considerations section in [1] for 
   more details.  In addition the result code defined in this document 
   is used in other control specifications and as such their individual 
   security considerations must be examined.
