Abstract

   This specification defines an attribute of a user identity which
   contains a set of statements expressed in the Resource Description
   Framework and encoded in XML.  An encoding of the attribute is
   defined for transport in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP), in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and the
   OpenID Attribute Exchange Protocol.

Internet-Draft      Identity Associated RDF Attribute           May 2007


1.  Introduction

   In an identity metasystem [14], when an end user requests access to a
   service, the network interactions for authenticating and authorizing
   that user can involve three parties: a relying party, an identity
   provider, and the end user.  The relying party is the network entity
   which requires the identity of a user in order to make an access
   control decision.  The identity provider is the network entity which
   establishes the identity of the end user.

   The Resource Description Framework (RDF) [2] is a general-purpose
   language for representing information in the Web. In particular, RDF
   is used to describe the metadata of attribute types in the OpenID
   Attribute Exchange protocol [9], to describe people and relationships
   in FOAF [12], and in the Higgins Trust Framework Eclipse Project [13]
   to unify identity data description formats across multiple protocols.

   An example of the data which might be described in FOAF is:

   <foaf:Person>
   <foaf:name>Joe Bloggs</foaf:name>
   <foaf:mbox_sha1sum>24...2e</foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://example.org/people/jb/" />
   <foaf:img rdf:resource="http://example.org/people/jb/me.jpg" />
   </foaf:Person>

   An example of the data which might be described in Higgins is:

   <pwf:Person rdf:about="urn:mary">
   <pwf:friend rdf:resource="urn:sr-to-bob"/>
   </pwf:Person>

   <higgins:SubjectRelationship rdf:about="urn:sr-to-bob">
   <higgins:contextURI rdf:datatype=&xsd;anyURI">
   http://example.com/robertjones/public-business-card
   </higgins:contextURI>
   <higgins:subjectCUID>bob</higgins:subjectCUID>
   </higgins:SubjectRelationship>

   It is desirable for this information to be expressed in the RDF
   syntax without needing to be translated to the attribute syntax of an
   underlying transfer protocol, as such a transfer might lose the
   semantics associated with the RDF definitions.

   This specification defines an attribute of a user identity that is
   intended for use in an identity metasystem, for an identity provider
   to specify RDF triples associated with a user.

2.  Attribute definition

   This specification defines an attribute of a user identity that is
   generated by an identity provider to specify associated RDF data of
   the identity.

2.1.  General Syntax

   Attributes of this type can contain one or more values, and each
   value is a string encoded in UTF-8 containing an XML document.

2.2.  Representation in LDAP

   This attribute can be part of a user's entry held in a directory
   server based on the LDAP [4] data model.  The schema definitions are
   based on the LDAP directory information models [5].

   The attribute type is defined as follows (with lines wrapped for
   readability):

   attributeTypes: ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.21008.97.74.3.1
                     NAME 'associatedRdf'
                     EQUALITY caseExactMatch
                     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   The caseExactMatch and Directory String syntax are defined in RFC
   4517 [6].

2.2.1.  Base URI

   While each entry in an LDAP directory has a URI [3] (an LDAP URI),
   this URI might not useful for the subject of triples describing the
   identity.  An RDF/XML document, if intended to be a value of an
   attribute stored in an LDAP directory, MAY include a xml:base XML
   attribute, as defined in the XML Base [11] document, that specifies a
   base namespace.

2.2.2.  Object class definition

   In order to allow this class to be present on objects of many
   different structural classes, an auxiliary object class is defined.

       objectClasses: ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.21008.97.74.3.2
                       NAME 'associatedRdfClass'
                       AUXILIARY
                       MAY ( associatedRdf ) )

Internet-Draft      Identity Associated RDF Attribute           May 2007


   This auxiliary class might most usefully be combined with the person
   object class.

   Clients MUST NOT assume the absence of this class in an entry's
   objectClass implies that the associatedRdf attribute is not present
   in the entry, as this attribute might be part of a privately-defined
   schema object class, or be provided through collective attributes.

2.3.  Representation as a SAML 1.1 attribute

   This attribute can be expressed as a SAML 1.1 attribute.  The
   attribute is represented as if it is translated from LDAP to SAML 1.1
   using the method described in the MAC-Dir SAML Attribute Profile [7].

   In this representation, the SAML attribute name is

      urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21008.97.74.3.1

   The AttributeNamespace is

      urn:mace:shibboleth:1.0:attributeNamespace:uri

2.4.  Representation as a SAML 2.0 attribute

   This attribute can be expressed as a SAML 2.0 attribute.  The
   attribute is represented as if it is translated from LDAP to SAML 2.0
   using the method described in the SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute
   Profile [8].

   In this representation, the SAML attribute name is

      urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21008.97.74.3.1

   The FriendlyName is "associatedRdf".

   The attribute NameFormat is

      urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri

2.5.  Representation in OpenID Attribute Exchange

   This attribute can be transferred using the OpenID Attribute Exchange
   protocol [9].

   The attribute type identifier URI is

   http://www.ldap.com/1/schema/ardf/ardf.rdf#associatedRdf

   The data format URI is still to be determined (TBD).


   The data type of a value is an XML document.


2.6.  Representation as an Information Card claim

   This attribute can be expressed as an Information Card claim [10].
   This encoding is still under development (TBD).
