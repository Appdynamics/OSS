INTERNET-DRAFT                  CRAM-MD5                20 November 2008


Abstract

  This document recommends the retirement of the CRAM-MD5 authentication
  mechanism, and discusses the reasons for doing so.  This document
  recommends RFC 2195 and its predecessor, RFC 2095, be moved to
  Historic status.


  [[Note to RFC Editor: please publish at same time that [SCRAM] is
  published.]]


1. CRAM-MD5

  CRAM-MD5 [RFC2195] is a authentication mechanism.  It was originally
  designed for use in Internet Messaging Access Protocol (IMAP)
  [RFC3501] and Post Office Protocol (POP) [RFC1939].  It is also
  registered as a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
  [RFC4422] mechanism [IANA-SASL], though it has not been formally
  specified as SASL mechanism.

  CRAM-MD5 is a simple challenge/response protocol for establishing that
  both parties have knowledge of a shared secret derived from the user's
  password, presumedly a sequence of characters.

  While CRAM-MD5 is widely implemented and deployed on the Internet,
  interoperability is only possible where the client and server have an
  a priori agreement on the character set and encoding of the password,
  and any normalization to be applied before input to the cryptographic
  functions applied by both client and server.   Even where the client
  and server are implemented by the same developer, the client and
  server will not operate properly in absence of an a priori agreement
  (such as "passwords shall be a sequence of ASCII printable characters,
  encoded in a octet with zero parity, with no normalization").

  CRAM-MD5 does not provide adequate security services for use on the
  Internet.  CRAM-MD5 does not protect the user's authentication
  identifier from eavesdroppers.  CRAM-MD5 challenge/response exchange
  is subject to a number of passive and active attacks.

  CRAM-MD5 does not provide any data security services nor channel
  bindings [CBIND] to data security services (e.g., TLS [RFC5246])
  provided externally.

  RFC 2195 states no recommendation (or mandate) that implementors only
  offer CRAM-MD5 when external data security services are in place.  RFC
  2195 does not recommend (or mandate) that implementations supporting
  CRAM-MD5 implement any external data security service.

INTERNET-DRAFT                  CRAM-MD5                20 November 2008


  While it possible to revise RFC 2195 to address these and other
  deficiencies of the authentication mechanism, these changes would be
  disruptive to existing deployments.  For instance, if a revision were
  to specify that a particular character set, encoding, and
  normalization of the password is to be used, this mandate would
  disruptive to deployers who use an incompatible character set,
  encoding, and/or normalization.  Addition of additional security
  features, such as channel bindings, seems more appropriately done by
  introduced in a new mechanism.


2. Recommendations

  It is recommended RFC 2195 and its predecessor, RFC 2095, be moved to
  Historic status.

  It is recommended that application protocol designers and deployers
  consider the SASL PLAIN [RFC4616] mechanism protected by TLS [RFC5246]
  and/or the SASL Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism
  (SCRAM) [SCRAM] as alternatives to CRAM-MD5.


3. Security Considerations

  The retirement of CRAM-MD5 may lead to use of stronger authentication
  mechanisms and, hence, may improve Internet security.


4. IANA Considerations

  It is requested that IANA update the SASL CRAM-MD5 registration upon
  publication approval of this document.
