              <h2>Base64 Processing</h2>

              <p>
                Base64 is a mechanism of encoding data in a form that can always be represented as
                plain text.  It does this by converting three 8-bit values into four 6-bit values
                and representing that 6-bit data using a set of 64 characters (uppercase letters,
                lowercase letters, numeric digits, the plus sign and the forward slash).  It is a
                safe and relatively compact way to represent binary data in a text form.  It is
                used in LDIF processing if the data contains special characters that may not
                otherwise be safe to represent in LDIF form.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <tt>com.unboundid.util.Base64</tt> class provides a mechanism that can be used
                to encode data to and from base64.  The <tt>decode(String data)</tt> method can be
                used to decode a string containing base64-encoded data to a byte array.  The
                <tt>encode(byte[] data)</tt> and <tt>encode(byte[] data, StringBuilder buffer)</tt>
                methods can be used to base64-encode data from a byte array to a string
                representation.
