              <h2>System Requirements</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is a pure Java API for interacting with LDAP
                directory servers.  It requires only a Java SE 7 or higher environment.  It has
                been extensively tested with Java SE versions 7, 8, and 11.  It does not require
                any additional libraries that are not provided with Java SE.
              </p>

              <p>
                Versions of the LDAP SDK prior to 4.0.0 are supported for Java SE 5 and later.
                No version of the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java can be used with Java 1.4 or
                earlier releases, nor is it compatible with Java ME.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is supported for use on the Android platform and can be used to create
                applications which run on devices using that platform, although some peripheral
                functionality (e.g., support for certain SASL mechanisms, including CRAM-MD5,
                DIGEST-MD5, and GSSAPI) may not be available.
              </p>
