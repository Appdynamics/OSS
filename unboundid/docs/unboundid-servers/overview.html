              <h2>Overview of Additional UnboundID-Specific Functionality</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a significant amount of additional
                functionality that is available for use when the SDK is used to communicate with
                an instance of the Ping Identity, UnboundID, or Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661
                Directory Server.  This page describes that additional functionality.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Additional Controls</h3>

              <p>
                The following additional controls are available when communicating with a
                Ping Identity, UnboundID, or Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 Directory Server instance:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Account Usability Control</b> -- Provides information about whether a
                  specified user account is available for use, and if not information about why it
                  may be unavailable.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Administrative Operation Control</b> -- Indicates that the associated request
                  is intended for some administrative purpose rather than a general application
                  request.  Operations with this control may be treated specially by the server,
                  including placing additional information in access log messages and excluding
                  them from inclusion in response time histogram tracking.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Assured Replication Control</b> -- May be used to indicate that the server
                  should delay the response to the associated write operation until it receives
                  confirmation that the change has been replicated to other local or remote
                  servers in the topology, in accordance with the desired asurance criteria.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Batched Transaction Specification Control</b> -- Indicates that the associated
                  operation is part of a batched transaction.  This must be used in conjunction
                  with the start batched transaction and end batched transaction extended
                  operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Exclude Branch Control</b> -- Provides the ability to exclude entries in
                  a specified set of branches from search results.
                  <br><br>

                <li>
                  <b>Extended Schema Information Control</b> -- Provides the ability to request
                  that the server return extended information (including information about
                  the files in which schema elements are defined and whether those definitions are
                  considered read-only) as part of the server schema.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Generate Password Control</b> -- May be included in an add request to
                  indicate that the server should generate a password for the new entry and
                  return it to the client in a corresponding response control.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Get Authorization Entry Control</b> -- Provides the ability to retrieve the
                  entries for the authentication and/or authorization entries for the user in the
                  bind response received from the server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Get Backend Set ID Control</b> -- Provides a way for the client to request
                  information from a Directory Proxy Server about the entry balancing backend sets
                  in which an operation was processed.  It may be used in conjunction with the
                  route to backend set request control to request that subsequent operations be
                  processed within specified backend sets.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Get Password Policy State Issues Control</b> -- May be included in a bind
                  request (that meets additional security criteria) to request that the server
                  return extended information about password policy-related issues that may
                  affect the user's ability to authenticate, either now or in the near future.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Get Server ID Control</b> -- Provides a way for the client to request
                  information about which server was actually used to process a request (including
                  the ability to make that determination through a Directory Proxy Server).  It
                  may be used in conjunction with the route to server request control to request
                  that an operation be processed by a specific server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  <b>Get User Resource Limits Control</b> -- May be included in a bind request to
                  indicate that the server should return information about resource limits that
                  will be enforced for the authenticated user, including size limit, time limit,
                  lookthrough limit, and idle time limit.  Other information returned may include
                  the name of the selected client connection policy, the DNs of the groups in
                  which the user is a member, and the names of any privileges assigned to that
                  user.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Hard Delete Control</b> -- May be included in a delete request to indicate
                  that the target entry should be completely removed from the server, even if it
                  would have otherwise been soft-deleted.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Ignore NO-USER-MODIFICATION Control</b> -- Provides the ability to add an
                  entry to a Directory Server that already contains attributes which may be marked
                  NO-USER-MODIFICATION in the server schema.
                  <br><br>

                <li>
                  <b>Interactive Transaction Specification Control</b> -- Indicates that the
                  specified operation is part of an interactive transaction.  This must be used in
                  conjunction with the start interactive transaction and end interactive
                  transaction extended operations.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Intermediate Client Control</b> -- May be used to help track requests and
                  responses through a directory environment (e.g., between a client, a directory
                  proxy server, and a directory server).

                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Matching Entry Count Control</b> -- May be included in a search request to
                  indicate that the server should merely return an estimate of the number of
                  entries that match the search criteria rather than actually returning the
                  matching entries themselves.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  <b>Name With entryUUID Control</b> -- May be included in an add request to
                  indicate that the resulting entry should use the server-generated entryUUID
                  attribute as its naming (RDN) attribute, rather than using the RDN that was
                  provided in the add request.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>No Operation Control</b> -- Provides the ability to request that the server
                  validate that a write operation would likely succeed, but without making any
                  changes to data in the server.
                  <br><br>

                <li>
                  <b>Override Search Limits Control</b> -- May be included in a search request
                  to indicate that the server should use client-specified values for certain
                  resource limits rather than the limits that would normally be imposed.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>

                  or password modify request to obtain information about the requirements that a

                  have otherwise permitted the search for the requester.

                  that the server should process the operation as a soft delete, in which the
