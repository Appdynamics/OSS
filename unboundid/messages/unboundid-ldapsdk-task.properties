INFO_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_BACKEND_ID=The backend IDs of the \
  backends in which composed values should be generated.  If this is not \
  specified, then an appropriate set of backends will automatically be \
  determined from the base DN criteria defined in the configurations of the \
  selected plugin instances.
INFO_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_MAX_RATE=Max Rate Per Second
INFO_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_MAX_RATE=The maximum number of \
  entries to update per second with composed values.  If this is not \
  specified, then no rate limit will be imposed.
INFO_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_PLUGIN_CONFIG=Plugin Configurations
INFO_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_PLUGIN_CONFIG=The names or DNs of the \
  configuration entries for the composed attribute plugins for which to \
  generate values.  If this is not specified, then values will be generated \
  enabled composed attribute plugin instances defined in the configuration.
INFO_TASK_NAME_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_VALUES=Populate Composed Attribute Values
INFO_TASK_DESCRIPTION_POPULATE_COMPOSED_ATTR_VALUES=Generates composed values \
  for existing entries in the Directory Server.
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_INCLUDE_PATH=Include Paths
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_INCLUDE_PATH=A set of paths to \
  additional files or directories within the instance root that should be \
  included in the generated server profile.  Relative paths will be relative \
  to the instance root.
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_PROFILE_ROOT=Profile Root
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_PROFILE_ROOT=The path to the \
  zip file or directory on the server filesystem to which the generated \
  server profile should be written.  This may be an absolute path or a \
  relative path that is relative to the instance root.  If the server profile \
  is to be packaged into a zip file, then this may either be the path to the \
  zip file to be created (which must not yet exist, although its parent \
  directory must exist), or the path to the directory in which the zip file \
  will be created with a server-generated name.  If the profile will not be \
  packaged into a zip file, then this must be the path to the directory in \
  which the profile will be written, and either that directory must exist and \
  be empty, or it must not exist but its parent directory must exist.  If \
  this is not provided, then a zip file or directory will be created in the \
  instance root directory.
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_RETAIN_AGE=Retain Previous \
  Profile Age
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_RETAIN_AGE=The minimum age of \
  previous profile zip files that should be retained.  This may only be \
  provided if the server profile will be packaged into a zip file, and if the \
  name of the zip file will be generated by the server (that is, the profile \
  root specifies a directory rather than a file).  If this is provided, then \
  any preexisting profile zip files older than this age may be deleted.  \
  Duration values should be specified as an integer followed by a time unit \
  (millisecond, second, minute, hour, day, or week, or any of their plurals), \
  like ''5 minutes'' or ''1 hour''.  If this is not provided, the server \
  will either use only a count to determine the number of files to retain (if \
  a count was provided) or will not remove any previous profiles (if no count \
  was provided).
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_RETAIN_COUNT=Retain Previous \
  Profile Count
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_RETAIN_COUNT=The minimum number \
  of previous profile zip files that should be retained.  This may only be \
  provided if the server profile will be packaged into a zip file, and if the \
  name of the zip file will be generated by the server (that is, the profile \
  root specifies a directory rather than a file).  If this is provided, then \
  at least the specified number of the most recent preexisting profile zip \
  files will be retained, but older archives may be removed.  If this is not \
  provided, the server will either use only a duration to determine which \
  profile zip files to retain (if a retain age was provided) or will not \
  remove any previous files (if no retain age was provided).
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DISPLAY_NAME_ZIP=Zip Profile
INFO_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ATTR_DESCRIPTION_ZIP=Indicates whether the \
  generated server profile should be packaged into a zip file.
ERR_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_ENTRY_INVALID_RETAIN_AGE=Unable to create a \
  generate server profile task from entry ''{0}'' because it has an invalid \
  retain age value of ''{1}'':  {2}
ERR_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_PROPS_INVALID_RETAIN_AGE=Unable to create a \
  generate server profile task from the provided property set because it has \
  an invalid retain age value of ''{0}'':  {1}
INFO_TASK_NAME_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE=Generate Server Profile
INFO_TASK_DESCRIPTION_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE=Generates a server profile that \
  may be used to create a new instance of the server with the same \
  configuration and setup as the instance from which the profile is \
  obtained.  The resulting profile may be written as a directory structure or \
  packaged into a zip file.
ERR_GENERATE_SERVER_PROFILE_CANNOT_PARSE_RETAIN_AGE=Unable to parse retain \
  age value ''{0}'' as a duration:  {1}
INFO_REMOVE_ATTR_TYPE_DISPLAY_NAME_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE=Attribute Type
INFO_REMOVE_ATTR_TYPE_DESCRIPTION_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE=The name or OID of the \
  attribute type to remove from the server schema.
ERR_REMOVE_ATTR_TYPE_ENTRY_MISSING_ATTR_TYPE=Unable to create a remove \
  attribute type task from the information in the provided entry ''{0}'' \
  because the entry is missing the required attribute ''{1}'' used to specify \
  the name or OID of the attribute type to remove.
ERR_REMOVE_ATTR_TYPE_PROPS_MISSING_ATTR_TYPE=Unable to create a remove \
  attribute type task from the provided set of properties because the \
  required ''{0}'' property (used to specify the name or OID of the attribute \
  type to remove) was not included.
INFO_REMOVE_ATTR_TYPE_TASK_NAME=Remove Attribute Type
INFO_REMOVE_ATTR_TYPE_TASK_DESCRIPTION=Safely removes an attribute type from \
  the server schema after ensuring that it is not in use.
