  with a timestamp.
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_TIMESTAMP=The log message string does not appear to \
  start with a valid timestamp:  {0}
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_ESCAPED_CHARACTER=The log message string appears to \
  contain an invalid escaped character in token ''{0}'' because it contains a \
  backslash not followed by two hexadecimal digits.
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_REQUEST_OPERATION_TYPE=The log message string appears \
  to contain an operation request but did not have a recognized operation type.
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_RESULT_OPERATION_TYPE=The log message string appears \
  to contain an operation result but did not have a recognized operation type.
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_FORWARD_OPERATION_TYPE=The log message string appears \
  to contain n forwarded operation but did not have a recognized operation \
  type.

  appears to contain a failed forwarded operation but did not have a \
  recognized operation type.
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_ASSURANCE_COMPLETE_OPERATION_TYPE=The log message \
  string appears to contain information about an operation for which \
  replication assurance processing had been completed, but the message did \
  not have a recognized operation type.
ERR_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_ACCESS_MESSAGE_TYPE=The log message string does not \
  include a recognized access log message type.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LIST_NULL=Unable to create an audit log message from a \
  log message line list that is null.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LIST_EMPTY=Unable to create an audit log message from a \
  log message line list that is empty.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LIST_CONTAINS_EMPTY_LINE=Unable to create an audit log \
  message from a log message line list that contains an empty line.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LIST_DOES_NOT_START_WITH_COMMENT=Unable to create an \
  audit log message from a log message line list that does not start with a \
  comment line that represents the log message header.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LIST_CANNOT_PARSE_HEADER=Unable to create an audit log \
  message from the provided log message line list because the first line in \
  that list (''{0}'') cannot be parsed as a valid audit log message header:  \
  {1}
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_HEADER_NO_SEMICOLONS=The header line does not contain \
  any semicolons to separate header elements.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_HEADER_MALFORMED_TIMESTAMP=Unable to parse the first \
  element of the header line as a timestamp.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_HEADER_ENDS_WITH_PROPERTY_NAME=The header line ends \
  with what appears to be a partial or complete property name (''{0}'') with \
  no equal sign to denote the start of the property value.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_HEADER_EMPTY_PROPERTY_NAME=The header line contains an \
  equal sign after a property delimiter, indicating a property with an empty \
  name.

  to read the value of property ''{0}'' as a JSON object:  {1}
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_END_BEFORE_CLOSING_QUOTE=Unable to read the quoted \
  string value of property ''{0}'' because the end of the string was reached \
  before finding the closing quote.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_END_BEFORE_ESCAPED=Unable to read the string value of \
  property ''{0}'' because the end of the string was reached immediately \
  after a backslash that was expected to escape the next character.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_END_BEFORE_HEX=Unable to read the string value of \
  property ''{0}'' because the end of the string was reached before finding \
  both hexadecimal digits following the octothorpe (#) character.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_INVALID_HEX_DIGIT=Unable to read the string value of \
  property ''{0}'' because the value contained an octothorpe (#) character \
  that was not immediately followed by two valid hexadecimal digits.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_UNEXPECTED_CHAR_AFTER_PROPERTY=Found unexpected \
  character ''{0}'' after reading the value of property ''{1}''.  Only spaces \
  and a semicolon were expected.
ERR_ADD_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_CHANGE_TYPE_NOT_ADD=Unable to parse the provided \
  lines as an add audit log message because while the lines could be parsed \
  as a valid LDIF change record, the change record had a change type of \
  ''{0}'' instead of the expected change type of ''{1}''.
ERR_ADD_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LINES_NOT_CHANGE_RECORD=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as an add audit log message because they could not be parsed \
  as a valid LDIF change record:  {0}
ERR_DELETE_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_CHANGE_TYPE_NOT_DELETE=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as a delete audit log message because while the lines could \
  be parsed as a valid LDIF change record, the change record had a change \
  type of ''{0}'' instead of the expected change type of ''{1}''.
ERR_DELETE_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LINES_NOT_CHANGE_RECORD=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as a delete audit log message because they could not be \
  parsed as a valid LDIF change record:  {0}
ERR_DELETE_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_SUBTREE_DELETE_WITHOUT_ENTRY=Unable to create a \
  list of revert change records for the subtree delete based at entry ''{0}'' \
  because that audit log message in itself does not contain enough \
  information to restore the entire subtree.  Further, even the base entry \
  cannot be recreated because the delete audit log message is not in \
  reversible form.
ERR_DELETE_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_SUBTREE_DELETE_WITH_ENTRY=Unable to create a \
  list of revert change records for the subtree delete based at entry ''{0}'' \
  because that audit log message in itself does not contain enough \
  information to restore the entire subtree.  However, this record does have \
  enough information to restore just the base entry, and the necessary revert \
  change record can be manually obtained by creating an LDIF add change \
  record from the deleted entry.
ERR_DELETE_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_NO_SOFT_DELETED_ENTRY_DN=Unable to create a list \
  of revert change records for the soft-delete of entry ''{0}'' because the \
  audit log message did not contain the DN of the resulting soft-deleted entry.
ERR_DELETE_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_DELETED_ENTRY=Unable to create a list of revert \
  change records for the delete of entry ''{0}'' because the audit log \
  message did not include the contents of the entry that was deleted.  Make \
  sure that the audit logger is configured to record changes in revertible \
  form.
ERR_MODIFY_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_CHANGE_TYPE_NOT_MODIFY=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as a modify audit log message because while the lines could \
  be parsed as a valid LDIF change record, the change record had a change \
  type of ''{0}'' instead of the expected change type of ''{1}''.
ERR_MODIFY_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LINES_NOT_CHANGE_RECORD=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as a modify audit log message because they could not be \
  parsed as a valid LDIF change record:  {0}
ERR_MODIFY_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_MOD_NOT_REVERTIBLE=Unable to create a list of \
  revert change records for the modify of entry ''{0}'' because the modify \
  audit log message included modification {1} that is not revertible.  Make \
  sure that the audit logger is configured to record changes in reversible \
  form.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_CHANGE_TYPE_NOT_MODIFY_DN=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as a modify DN audit log message because while the lines \
  could be parsed as a valid LDIF change record, the change record had a \
  change type of ''{0}'' instead of the expected change type of ''{1}''.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_AUDIT_LOG_MESSAGE_LINES_NOT_CHANGE_RECORD=Unable to parse the \
  provided lines as a modify DN audit log message because they could not be \
  parsed as a valid LDIF change record:  {0}
ERR_MODIFY_DN_NOT_REVERTIBLE=Unable to create a list of revert change records \
  for the modify DN of entry ''{0}'' because the modify DN audit log message \
  did not include a set of attribute modifications.  Make sure that the audit \
  logger is configured to record changes in reversible form.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_CANNOT_GET_NEW_DN_WITHOUT_NEW_SUPERIOR=Unable to create a list \
  of revert change records for the modify DN of entry ''{0}'' because either \
  the original DN or new RDN (''{1}'') could not be parsed.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_CANNOT_GET_NEW_DN_WITH_NEW_SUPERIOR=Unable to create a list of \
  revert change records for the modify DN of entry ''{0}'' because at least \
  one of the original DN, the new RDN (''{1}''), or the new superior DN \
  (''{2}'') could not be parsed.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_CANNOT_REVERT_NULL_DN=Unable to create a list of revert change \
  records for a modify DN that targets the root DSE.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_CANNOT_REVERT_WITHOUT_NECESSARY_MODS=Unable to create a list of \
  revert change records for the modify DN of entry ''{0}'' because the \
  log message did not include any attribute modifications, but attribute \
  modifications are required to determine the correct deleteOldRDN value.
ERR_MODIFY_DN_MOD_NOT_REVERTIBLE=Unable to create a list of revert change \
  records for the modify DN of entry ''{0}'' because the modify DN audit log \
  message included a non-revertible {1} modification for attribute ''{2}''.  \
  Make sure that the audit logger is configured to record changes in \
  reversible form.
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_READER_CANNOT_PARSE_CHANGE_RECORD=Unable to parse an LDIF \
  change record out of the audit log message with lines {0}:  {1}
ERR_AUDIT_LOG_READER_UNSUPPORTED_CHANGE_RECORD=Unable to create an audit log \
  message from the data contained in lines {0} because the parsed change log \
  had an unsupported change type of ''{1}''.
