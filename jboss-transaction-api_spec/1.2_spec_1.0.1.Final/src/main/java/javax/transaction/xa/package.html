<body>

This package contains the classes and interfaces that define the interaction
between the transaction manager and the resources it manages.
<p>
Classes and interfaces here are conforming to the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jta/">Java Transaction API
     (JTA) 1.0.1 specification</a>.

<p>
The interaction is modelled after the X/Open CAE Specification
(Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA Specification).

The <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/transaction_service.htm">CORBA CosTransactions specification</a> is freely available, and gives
a pretty good overview of the XA protocol.
