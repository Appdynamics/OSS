Changes
=======

1.3.1 (2016-02-08)
------------------

* `getAllCountryNames()` and `getAllCountryCodes()` were added to the
  `LookupService`. These return all country names and codes known to the
  GeoIP reader. Pull request by nguillaumin. GitHub #33.

1.3.0 (2016-01-21)
------------------

* `LookupService` will now throw an `InvalidDatabaseException` if there is a
  problem with the database. This is a unchecked, runtime exception in order
  to not introduce an API change. Previously `LookupService` would swallow
  exceptions, either returning `null` or an invalid value or throwing an
  exception such as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` cause by the invalid
  state.
* When using `GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE`, the number of allocations has been reduced,
  providing a moderate performance increase.
* Minor code clean-up and de-duplication.

1.2.15 (2015-07-17)
-------------------

* Several threading synchronization issues were fixed.
* Target version was decreased to 1.5 for increased compatibility.
* Minor code cleanup.
* Region and timezone data were updated.

1.2.14 (2014-07-23)
-------------------

* OSGi metadata was added to the jar. (Miguel √Ångel Pastor Olivar)
* Regions were updated.

1.2.13 (2014-04-30)
-------------------

* Previously no checks were done to ensure that an organization name did not
  exceed the 300 character maximum. If an organization name did exceed this
  maximum, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` was thrown.
* A potential string comparison issue was fixed in `getLocation`.
* Documentation and test fixes.

1.2.12 (2014-03-10)
-------------------

* Code and examples for the non-functional distributed lookup service were
  removed.
* A bug that could cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when using
  `GEOIP_INDEX_CACHE` was fixed. On the last node, the reader would attempt
  to read beyond the end of the buffer due to the incorrect record length
  being used.
