#This shell script invokes mvn to build GFv3.
#First the script will verify that mvn is installed and is in the path.  
#It will also verify JDK 1.6 is installed to compile GFv3.
# Syntax:
# gfbuild.sh [-r <maven-local-repo>] <maven-lifecycle-phase-operand>
# If -r or -Dmaven.local.repo is not specified, then the default maven repository 
# which is user's home directory (~/.m2/repository) is used.  
# When using -r to specify the maven-local-repo, the script checks if the directory
# exists.  The maven repo directory is created if it does not exist.  
# The script saves the build output in the file called gfbuild.log.t
#
# TO DO:
# "gfbuild.sh package"  builds the bundle withIPS packages.
# "gfbuild.sh installer" builds the GFv3 installer.

#check if maven 2 is installed and in the path
