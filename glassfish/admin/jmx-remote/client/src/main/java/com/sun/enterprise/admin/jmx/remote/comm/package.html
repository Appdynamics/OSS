Contains the classes and interfaces that implement low level communication details.
As of 08/03/2003, this implementation is internal and to be used only by the
command line interface over HTTP.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The classes and interfaces support HTTP and HTTPS transport. The server side
web application is such that it imposes configurable J2EE security and requires
specific HTTP headers before the client can create a connection. The client
side is a plain HTTP(S) client and reads/writes Serialized Java objects from
the socket input/output streams. The sockets are closed after every request is
processed. Leverages the connections provided by java.net.URL.
<P>
The implemented standard is JSR 160. Following are some of the links regarding 
the specification.
