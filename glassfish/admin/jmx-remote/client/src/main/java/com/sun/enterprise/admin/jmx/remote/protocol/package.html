Provides as the super package of the package where client providers for both
s1ashttp and s1ashttps exist. This package also contains the Version classes
for the client and server portions of JSR 160 implementation in S1AS. A template
is utilized to generate source code for Version class:
<ul>
    <li> SunOneVersion.java </li>
</ul>

Instances of SunOneVersion.java are serialized and sent from Client to Server
and <b> for every request </b> the version check in enforced. The major and
minor versions (and upgrade data) undergo a negotiation process and in case of a mismatch, an 
appropriate message is returned to client for software upgrade (of either client
or server).
