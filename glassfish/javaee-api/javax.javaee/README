This module bundles the Java(TM) EE 6 Specification APIs into one javaee-api jar.  The pom.xml file is not used to pushed to the maven repository.  It's primarly purpose is to assemble the javaee-api jar files.  There are three profiles in the pom.xml file:  
(1) api profile assembles javaee-api. This is the default profile.
(2) web-api profile assembles javaee-web-api.  This profile assembles just the JavaEE 6 web profile classes.
(3) endorsed-api profile assembles javaee-endorsed-api.  This profile assembles the endoresed JavaEE 6 classes.

To execute the profile, use the maven syntax:  "mvn -P api", "mvn -P web-api" or "mvn -P endorsed-api".  If profile is not provided, it defaults to "api".

Note that the jar assembled includes the impl classes.  You will need to execute maven from the directory, compact.  Please read compact/README.
