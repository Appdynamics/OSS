From Hudson:

         If this fails with 0x00000005 or 0x80070005,
            I found that the following makes a difference:

            "Control Panel" -> "Administrative Tools" -> "Local Security Policy"
             -> "Local Policies" -> "Security Options" -> "Network Access: Sharing security model for local accounts"

            Set this to classic, so that the specified credential of the local user is authenticaed accordingly,
            instead of as a guest, which won't have the access to the system.

I found the root cause of remote WMI access against a Windows 7 host.
The following registry key (WbemScripting.SWbemLocator) is owned by an non-existing
group called "TrunstedInstaller", and no other group or user have write access to it:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6}
My solution was (for the time being) to take ownership of this key and assign
it to the Administrators group. Everything works immediately
(with firewall disabled or properly configured).
I have not found the Microsoft documentation that offers the "correct" ways to
do this. It seems that the WbemScripting.SWbemLocator services was never properly
registered and with the permission mentioned above, it prevented the
autoRegistration feature of j-Interop to finish the job. Thanks --Michael


====   Nov 2, 2011
Tried a new approach.  Since it works perfectly on XP and not at all on W7, why not
try and make it break on XP to get information.

Experiment start.  Ran these 2 commands

call asadmin -W \pw install-node-dcom --force -w hudson --archive gfsmall.zip  --save --installdir c:\glassfish23 wnevins-lnr // XP
call asadmin -W \pw install-node-dcom --force -w hudson --archive gfsmall.zip  --save --installdir c:\glassfish23 vaio        // Windows 7

results:
1. lnr
-- worked perfectly.  unpack script ran just fine.

2. vaio

If you are using a DLL/OCX , please make sure it has "DllSurrogate" flag set. Faq A(6) in readme.html. [0x80040154]

3.  Now I went to the Registry and changed permissions of WScript.Shell like so:

KEY ==> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{72C24DD5-D70A-438B-8A42-98424B88AFB8}

change Permissions so that Administrators do NOT have "Full Control"

  YEAH!!  I at least can get EXACTLY the same error by tweaking the Win XP registry.
  I can make the error come and go at will simply by changing permissions on the Registry Key
=======================


http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h976cd1t%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
An administrator who wants to enable Remote WSH should add a subkey entry named Remote of type REG_SZ to the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Script Host\Settings. To enable Remote WSH, set the value of Remote to 1; to disable Remote WSH, set the value to 0. If the value of the Remote value is not set, by default Remote WSH is disabled.

Wow.  Maybe it's hopeless?  The XP machine has died -- BSOD

I tried it on "sony" my ancient XP machine and I get yet another error:


d:\gf\branches\3.1.2\cluster\cli>call asadmin -W \pw_vaio install-node-dcom --force -w bnevins --archive gfsmall.zip  --save --installdir c:\glassfish

1. Firewall
2. set permissions on HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6},
3. Turn on remote registry
4. JISystem.setAutoRegisteration(true);
5. Deactivate UAC

MSWMI sample runs perfectly
Copied code over to common-util.  Exact same code \ (of course!!) doesn't work:


remote failure: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method rpc.Stub.call(ILndr/NdrObject;)V from class org.jinterop.dcom.core.JIComServer
tried to access method rpc.Stub.call(ILndr/NdrObject;)V from class org.jinterop.dcom.core.JIComServer

****  stupid j-interop hides real error messages for my convenience.  Finally saw this one by
painstaking debugger work:


"No process is on the other end of the pipe."

which comes from:

==================================

seems like you're trying to do this the hard way.... You can install MSIs as group policy objects in an Active Directory domain. See: [Microsoft support info][1] If you want to do this in the manner you describe above, then you should put the MSI in a share with file share access, then you could use a remote command execution to execute the MSI. To do the remote execution you need to create a new instance of a Win32\_Process. See [this][2] for some C#/VB examples, but the mindeset is similar. Create the Win32_Process set the cmd line properties on it, then execute the "Create" method on the Win32\_Process.

	OK something is wrong wirth connecting to WMI.  I tried this next:

Then go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options :-

    Double-click "DCOM: Machine Access Restrictions" policy, click Edit Security, add the user created above, allow "Remote Access"
    Double-click "DCOM: Machine Launch Restrictions" policy, click Edit Security, add the user created above, allow "Local Launch", "Remote Launch", "Local Activation", "Remote Activation"
	--- No help ---
	Then tried this:

Go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Component Services > Computers > right-click My Computer > click Properties > click COM Security tab :-

    In Access Permissions section, click Edit Default > add the user created above, allow "Remote Access"
    In Launch and Activation Permissions section > click Edit Default > add the user created above, allow "Local Launch", "Remote Launch", "Local Activation", "Remote Activation"

	===  no help at all ===

	 Turned off UAc

	 =============
	 changed ownership and permissions on
	 HKCR\WBemScripting.SWBemlocator

========================
   From MSWMI example's readme.txt file
   This means WMI has rejected your connection request. This is not a j-Interop related problem. Make
   sure you have access to WMI on both the managing and the managed machines. On the WMI enabled
   machines, open "Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Computer Management/", then click on  "Services
   and Applications", then right-click on the "WMI Control", choose "Properties"; open the "Security"
   pane, click on the "Security" Button, and add the necessary account. If you are still having
   troubles, please consult WMI documentation at Platform SDK: Windows Management Instrumentation
   (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmisdk/wmi/wmi_start_page.asp)

Then I changed permissions on HKLM\Software\Classes\CLSID\76a64....
and I got a bit further:

=======================================
bigapp-oblade-3 appeared to have a problem with the unpack script.
I ran it in a debugger.  Just before remotel;y running the script I edited it on b-o-3 and
replace "jar" with the full path to "jar"
then it worked!!!
There may be Path issues.  I set the jdk in the path for EVERYONE.  Maybe it needs to be in there explicitly
for the actual user?!?

Later -- it apparently needed a reboot.  It would have an old stale Path until the reboot.

I believe you'll have to enable the SeBackupPrivilege first before you can set the owner of a file to be someone other than yourself. With an elevated shell:

PS C:\Windows\system32> $p.Enable("sebackupprivilege")

This should give you the neccessary rights to set the owner. The reason you need backup rights is because you are subverting the auditing; normally you can only give someone the right to _take_ ownership back.
