# JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF)

The JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is a standard extension to the
Java platform that lets you take advantage of standard services to:
determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to
it; discover the operations available on it; and instantiate the
appropriate bean to perform the operation(s).

JAF is used by [JavaMail](https://javaee.github.io/javamail)
and [JAX-WS](https://github.com/javaee/jax-ws-spec) for data content handling.

JAF is included in Java SE 6 and later.
