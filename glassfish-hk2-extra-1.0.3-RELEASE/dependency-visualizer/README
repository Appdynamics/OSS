# Dependency Visualizer

Reads a wires XML file generated by the dependency-verifier and outputs a dot
file. Uses [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to create images from the 
generated dot file. The tool helps visualizing the wiring dependencies between
packages. The tool also supports viewing the dependencies of only a subset of
the packages.

*To use the tool*
0. Install graphviz(http://www.graphviz.org/) in your machine.
1. Follow the steps below:
    - run mvn assembly:assembly to generate the visualizer jar
    - generate a wires.xml using the dependency-verifier project for 
the modules that needs to be analyzed
    - to visualize the dependencies of packages that have the word "web" in them,
run "./subset.sh web".
