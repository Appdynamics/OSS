/**
 * 
 * This project is a little real-time quote stock server.
 * 
 * The goal of this project was to create a demo and 
 * a migration guide : "How to convert NIO server to Grizzly.
 * 
 * A client can ask for a quote or a quote feed (the client will receive all update on the stock)
 * 
 * This server simulate a 3th party connection (where it will get the quotes for the symbols).
 * 
 * When this server lost the connection will the 3th party, it will reconnect and resend all the
 * quote feed request to the 3th party.
 * 
 * In a real application the server should be able to handle this : 
 * 
 * 50 clients simultany and 5000 symbols cached.  Of theses clients, there will be 5 admin (they will receive
 * all the symbols updates in realtime). There will be around 20 clients that will ask for 100 symbols quote feed.
 * And the others clients, will ask for a quote and disconnect after that.  We can expect have a request each second
 * from theses clients.
 * 
 * Remarks : 
 * 
 * The server will listen on a TCP port for incoming client.  A thread will be created for each client.
 * The server had a limited buffer size for parsing the client request.  If the buffer limit is reach, 
 * the server will close the connection with the client.
 * 
 * When a client request a quote, the server will return the latest quote from it cache if there was a 
 * quote feed requested.  When the client disconnect from the server, the server will stop the quote feed 
 * if there is no more client subscribe to the feed.  
 * 
 * When a client disconnect the server throws a java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException.
 * 
 * When the server lost the connection with the 3th party, it will resend all the quote feed, but if the
 * 3th party can't handle all the requests in the same time, it could close the connection, and we will be 
 * in a loop.  The server will resend all the request, and the 3th party will reclose the connection.
