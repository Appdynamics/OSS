/**

 * 
 * 	An injection target specifies a class and a name within
 * 	that class into which a resource should be injected.
 * 
 * 	The injection target class specifies the fully qualified
 * 	class name that is the target of the injection.  The
 * 	Java EE specifications describe which classes can be an
 * 	injection target.
 * 
 * 	The injection target name specifies the target within
 * 	the specified class.  The target is first looked for as a
 * 	JavaBeans property name.  If not found, the target is
 * 	looked for as a field name.
 * 
 * 	The specified resource will be injected into the target
 * 	during initialization of the class by either calling the
 * 	set method for the target property or by setting a value
 * 	into the named field.
